0	Hotelier Amugae has a hotel consisting of 10 rooms. The rooms are numbered from 0 to 9 from left to right.The hotel has two entrances — one from the left end, and another from the right end. When a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the left entrance. Similarly, when a customer arrives at the hotel through the right entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the right entrance.One day, Amugae lost the room assignment list. Thankfully Amugae's memory is perfect, and he remembers all of the customers: when a customer arrived, from which entrance, and when they left the hotel. Initially the hotel was empty. Write a program that recovers the room assignment list from Amugae's memory.
1	Block Adventure Gildong is playing a video game called . In Block Adventure, there are n columns of blocks in a row, and the columns are numbered from 1 to n. All blocks have equal heights. The height of the i-th column is represented as h_i, which is the number of blocks stacked in the i-th column.Gildong plays the game as a character that can stand only on the top of the columns. At the beginning, the character is standing on the top of the 1-st column. The goal of the game is to move the character to the top of the n-th column.The character also has a bag that can hold infinitely many blocks. When the character is on the top of the i-th column, Gildong can take one of the following three actions as many times as he wants: In actions of the first two types the character remains in the i-th column, and the value h_i changes.The character initially has m blocks in the bag. Gildong wants to know if it is possible to win the game. Help Gildong find the answer to his question.
2	Round Corridor Amugae is in a very large round corridor. The corridor consists of two areas. The inner area is equally divided by n sectors, and the outer area is equally divided by m sectors. A wall exists between each pair of sectors of same area (inner or outer), but there is no wall between the inner area and the outer area. A wall always exists at the 12 o'clock position.The inner area's sectors are denoted as (1,1), (1,2), \dots, (1,n) in clockwise direction. The outer area's sectors are denoted as (2,1), (2,2), \dots, (2,m) in the same manner. For a clear understanding, see the example image above.Amugae wants to know if he can move from one sector to another sector. He has q questions.For each question, check if he can move between two given sectors.
3	White Lines Gildong has bought a famous painting software . The working screen of cfpaint is square-shaped consisting of n rows and n columns of square cells. The rows are numbered from 1 to n, from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to n, from left to right. The position of a cell at row r and column c is represented as (r, c). There are only two colors for the cells in cfpaint — black and white.There is a tool named  in cfpaint. The eraser has an integer size k (1 \le k \le n). To use the eraser, Gildong needs to click on a cell (i, j) where 1 \le i, j \le n - k + 1. When a cell (i, j) is clicked, all of the cells (i', j') where i \le i' \le i + k - 1 and j \le j' \le j + k - 1 become white. In other words, a square with side equal to k cells and top left corner at (i, j) is colored white.A  is a row or a column without any black cells.Gildong has worked with cfpaint for some time, so some of the cells (possibly zero or all) are currently black. He wants to know the maximum number of  after using the eraser . Help Gildong find the answer to his question.
4	Compress Words Amugae has a sentence consisting of n words. He want to compress this sentence into one word. Amugae doesn't like repetitions, so when he merges two words into one word, he removes the longest prefix of the second word that coincides with a suffix of the first word. For example, he merges "" and "" into "".Amugae will merge his sentence left to right (i.e. first merge the first two words, then merge the result with the third word and so on). Write a program that prints the compressed word after the merging process ends.
5	Graph Traveler Gildong is experimenting with an interesting machine . In Graph Traveler, there is a directed graph consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. The i-th vertex has m_i outgoing edges that are labeled as e_i[0], e_i[1], \ldots, e_i[m_i-1], each representing the destination vertex of the edge. The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The i-th vertex also has an integer k_i written on itself.A  on this graph works as follows. It's obvious that a travel never ends, since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly.For example, assume that Gildong starts at vertex 1 with c = 5, and m_1 = 2, e_1[0] = 1, e_1[1] = 2, k_1 = -3. Right after he starts at vertex 1, c becomes 2. Since the only integer x (0 \le x \le 1) where x \equiv c \pmod {m_i} is 0, Gildong goes to vertex e_1[0] = 1. After arriving at vertex 1 again, c becomes -1. The only integer x satisfying the conditions is 1, so he goes to vertex e_1[1] = 2, and so on.Since Gildong is quite inquisitive, he's going to ask you q queries. He wants to know how many  vertices will be visited , if he starts the travel from a certain vertex with a certain value of c. Note that you should  count the vertices that will be visited only finite times.
6	Important Exam A class of students wrote a multiple-choice test.There are n students in the class. The test had m questions, each of them had 5 possible answers (A, B, C, D or E). There is exactly one correct answer for each question. The correct answer for question i worth a_i points. Incorrect answers are graded with zero points.The students remember what answers they gave on the exam, but they don't know what are the correct answers. They are very optimistic, so they want to know what is the maximum possible total score of all students in the class. 
7	Zero Array You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.In one operation you can choose two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j) and decrease each of them by one.You need to check whether it is possible to make all the elements equal to zero or not.
8	Maximum Median You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it:You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.The median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [1, 5, 2, 3, 5] is 3.
9	Treasure Hunting You are on the island which can be represented as a n \times m table. The rows are numbered from 1 to n and the columns are numbered from 1 to m. There are k treasures on the island, the i-th of them is located at the position (r_i, c_i).Initially you stand at the lower left corner of the island, at the position (1, 1). If at any moment you are at the cell with a treasure, you can pick it up without any extra time. In one move you can move up (from (r, c) to (r+1, c)), left (from (r, c) to (r, c-1)), or right (from position (r, c) to (r, c+1)). Because of the traps, you can't move down.However, moving up is also risky. You can move up only if you are in a safe column. There are q safe columns: b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_q. You want to collect all the treasures as fast as possible. Count the minimum number of moves required to collect all the treasures.
10	You Are Given Two Binary Strings... You are given two binary strings x and y, which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as f(x) and f(y)). You can choose any integer k \ge 0, calculate the expression s_k = f(x) + f(y) \cdot 2^k and write the binary representation of s_k in  (let's denote it as rev_k). For example, let x = 1010 and y = 11; you've chosen k = 1 and, since 2^1 = 10_2, so s_k = 1010_2 + 11_2 \cdot 10_2 = 10000_2 and rev_k = 00001.For given x and y, you need to choose such k that rev_k is  (read notes if you don't know what does "lexicographically" means).It's guaranteed that, with given constraints, k exists and is finite.
11	You Are Given a Decimal String... Suppose you have a special x-y-counter. This counter can store some value as a decimal number; at first, the counter has value 0. The counter performs the following algorithm: it prints its lowest digit and, after that, adds either x or y to its value. So all sequences this counter generates are starting from 0. For example, a 4-2-counter can act as follows:This is only one of the possible outputs; for example, the same counter could generate 0246802468024 as the output, if we chose to add 2 during each step.You wrote down a printed sequence from one of such x-y-counters. But the sequence was corrupted and several elements from the sequence could be erased.Now you'd like to recover data you've lost, but you don't even know the type of the counter you used. You have a decimal string s — the remaining data of the sequence. For all 0 \le x, y < 10, calculate the minimum number of digits you have to insert in the string s to make it a possible output of the x-y-counter. Note that you can't change the order of digits in string s or erase any of them; only insertions are allowed.
12	You Are Given a WASD-string... You have a string s — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a  grid. He can perform four commands:Let Grid(s) be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands s. For example, if s = \text{DSAWWAW} then Grid(s) is the 4 \times 3 grid:You have 4 extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insert  in any position of sequence s to minimize the area of Grid(s).What is the minimum area of Grid(s) you can achieve?
13	Print a 1337-string... You are given an integer n. You have to find a sequence s consisting of digits \{1, 3, 7\} such that it has exactly n subsequences equal to 1337.For example, sequence 337133377 has 6 subsequences equal to 1337: You have to answer t independent queries.
14	You Are Given Some Strings... You are given a string t and n strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n. All strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.Let f(t, s) be the number of occurences of string s in string t. For example, f('\text{aaabacaa}', '\text{aa}') = 3, and f('\text{ababa}', '\text{aba}') = 2.Calculate the value of \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} f(t, s_i + s_j), where s + t is the concatenation of strings s and t. Note that if there are two pairs i_1, j_1 and i_2, j_2 such that s_{i_1} + s_{j_1} = s_{i_2} + s_{j_2}, you should include both f(t, s_{i_1} + s_{j_1}) and f(t, s_{i_2} + s_{j_2}) in answer.
15	You Are Given Some Letters... You are given a uppercase Latin letters 'A' and b letters 'B'.The period of the string is the smallest such positive integer k that s_i = s_{i~mod~k} (0-indexed) for each i. Note that this implies that k won't always divide a+b = |s|.For example, the period of string "ABAABAA" is 3, the period of "AAAA" is 1, and the period of "AABBB" is 5.Find the number of different periods over all possible strings with a letters 'A' and b letters 'B'.
16	Circle of Students There are n students standing in a circle in some order. The index of the i-th student is p_i. It is guaranteed that all indices of students are distinct integers from 1 to n (i. e. they form a permutation).Students want to start a round dance. A  round dance can be started if the student 2 comes right after the student 1 in clockwise order (there are no students between them), the student 3 comes right after the student 2 in clockwise order, and so on, and the student n comes right after the student n - 1 in clockwise order. A  round dance is almost the same thing — the only difference is that the student i should be right after the student i - 1 in counterclockwise order (this condition should be met for every i from 2 to n). For example, if the indices of students listed in clockwise order are [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], then they can start a clockwise round dance. If the students have indices [3, 2, 1, 4] in clockwise order, then they can start a counterclockwise round dance.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to start a round dance. Note that the students cannot change their positions before starting the dance; they cannot swap or leave the circle, and no other student can enter the circle. You have to answer q independent queries.
17	Equal Rectangles You are given 4n sticks, the length of the i-th stick is a_i.You have to create n rectangles, each rectangle will consist of exactly 4 sticks from the given set. The rectangle consists of four sides, opposite sides should have equal length and all angles in it should be right. Note that each stick can be used in only one rectangle. Each stick should be used as a side, you cannot break the stick or use it not to the full length.You want to all rectangles to have equal area. The area of the rectangle with sides a and b is a \cdot b.Your task is to say if it is possible to create exactly n rectangles of equal area or not.You have to answer q independent queries.
18	Common Divisors You are given an array a consisting of n integers.Your task is to say the number of such positive integers x such that x divides  number from the array. In other words, you have to find the number of common divisors of all elements in the array.For example, if the array a will be [2, 4, 6, 2, 10], then 1 and 2 divide each number from the array (so the answer for this test is 2).
19	Boxers There are n boxers, the weight of the i-th boxer is a_i. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1 before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).Write a program that for given current values ​a_i will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001 (but no more).
20	BowWow and the Timetable In the city of Saint Petersburg, a day lasts for 2^{100} minutes. From the main station of Saint Petersburg, a train departs after 1 minute, 4 minutes, 16 minutes, and so on; in other words, the train departs at time 4^k for each integer k \geq 0. Team BowWow has arrived at the station at the time s and it is trying to count how many trains have they missed; in other words, the number of trains that have departed  time s. For example if s = 20, then they missed trains which have departed at 1, 4 and 16. As you are the only one who knows the time, help them!Note that the number s will be given you in a  without leading zeroes.
21	Mislove Has Lost an Array Mislove had an array a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n of n positive integers, but he has lost it. He only remembers the following facts about it:For example, if n=5, l=2, r=3 then an array could be [1,2,2,4,4] or [1,1,1,1,2]; but it couldn't be [1,2,2,4,8] because this array contains 4 different numbers; it couldn't be [1,2,2,3,3] because 3 is odd and isn't equal to 1; and it couldn't be [1,1,2,2,16] because there is a number 16 in the array but there isn't a number \frac{16}{2} = 8.According to these facts, he is asking you to count the minimal and the maximal possible sums of all elements in an array. 
22	Anna, Svyatoslav and Maps You are given a directed unweighted graph without loops with n vertexes and a path in it (that path is not necessary simple) given by a sequence p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m of m vertexes; for each 1 \leq i < m there is an arc from p_i to p_{i+1}.Define the sequence v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k of k vertexes as , if v is a subsequence of p, v_1 = p_1, v_k = p_m, and p is one of the shortest paths passing through the vertexes v_1, \ldots, v_k in that order.A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. It is obvious that the sequence p is good but your task is to find the  good subsequence.If there are multiple shortest good subsequences, output any of them. 
23	Natasha, Sasha and the Prefix Sums Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, \ldots ,l} of length l \geq 0. Then: f(a) = \max (0, \smash{\displaystyle\max_{1 \leq i \leq l}} \sum_{j=1}^{i} a_j )Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.
24	Almost Equal You are given integer n. You have to arrange numbers from 1 to 2n, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied:For every n consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard 2n numbers differ not more than by 1.For example, choose n = 3. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: 1 + 4 + 5 = 10, 4 + 5 + 2 = 11, 5 + 2 + 3 = 10, 2 + 3 + 6 = 11, 3 + 6 + 1 = 10, 6 + 1 + 4 = 11, any two numbers differ by at most 1. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, 5 + 1 + 6 = 12, and 3 + 2 + 4 = 9, 9 and 12 differ more than by 1.
25	Shortest Cycle You are given n integer numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Consider graph on n nodes, in which nodes i, j (i\neq j) are connected if and only if, a_i AND a_j\neq 0, where AND denotes the .Find the length of the shortest cycle in this graph or determine that it doesn't have cycles at all.
26	Palindromic Paths You are given a grid n\times n, where n is . Rows are enumerated from 1 to n from up to down, columns are enumerated from 1 to n from left to right. Cell, standing on the intersection of row x and column y, is denoted by (x, y).Every cell contains 0 or 1. It is known that the top-left cell contains 1, and the bottom-right cell contains 0.We want to know numbers in all cells of the grid. To do so we can ask the following questions: "", where 1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le n, 1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le n, and x_1 + y_1 + 2 \le x_2 + y_2. In other words, we output two different cells (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) of the grid such that we can get from the first to the second by moving only to the right and down, and they aren't adjacent.As a response to such question you will be told if there exists a path between (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), going only to the right or down, numbers in cells of which form a palindrome.For example, paths, shown in green, are palindromic, so answer for "" and "" would be that there exists such path. However, there is no palindromic path between (1, 1) and (3, 1).Determine all cells of the grid by asking not more than n^2 questions. It can be shown that the answer always exists.
27	Almost All You are given a tree with n nodes. You have to write non-negative integers on its edges so that the following condition would be satisfied:For every two nodes i, j, look at the path between them and count the sum of numbers on the edges of this path. Write all obtained sums on the blackboard. Then every integer from 1 to \lfloor \frac{2n^2}{9} \rfloor has to be written on the blackboard at least once. It is guaranteed that such an arrangement exists.
28	Expected Value Again You are given integers n, k. Let's consider the alphabet consisting of k different elements.Let  f(s) of the string s be the number of indexes i, 1\le i<|s|, for which prefix of s of length i equals to suffix of s of length i. For example, beauty of the string abacaba equals 2, as for i = 1, 3 prefix and suffix of length i are equal.Consider all words of length n in the given alphabet. Find the expected value of f(s)^2 of a uniformly chosen at random word. We can show that it can be expressed as \frac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are coprime and Q isn't divided by 10^9 + 7. Output P\cdot Q^{-1} \bmod 10^9 + 7.
29	Beauty of a Permutation Define the beauty of a permutation of numbers from 1 to n (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n) as number of pairs (L, R) such that 1 \le L \le R \le n and numbers p_L, p_{L+1}, \dots, p_R are consecutive R-L+1 numbers in some order. For example, the beauty of the permutation (1, 2, 5, 3, 4) equals 9, and segments, corresponding to pairs, are [1], [2], [5], [4], [3], [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 3, 4], [1, 2, 5, 3, 4].Answer q independent queries. In each query, you will be given integers n and k. Determine if there exists a permutation of numbers from 1 to n with beauty equal to k, and if there exists, output one of them.
30	Choose Two Numbers You are given an array A, consisting of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, and an array B, consisting of m positive integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m. Choose some element a of A and some element b of B such that a+b doesn't belong to A and doesn't belong to B. For example, if A = [2, 1, 7] and B = [1, 3, 4], we can choose 1 from A and 4 from B, as number 5 = 1 + 4 doesn't belong to A and doesn't belong to B. However, we can't choose 2 from A and 1 from B, as 3 = 2 + 1 belongs to B.It can be shown that such a pair exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.Choose and print any such two numbers.
31	Make Product Equal One You are given n numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:Choose one of these numbers and add or subtract 1 from it.In particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.We want to make the product of all these numbers equal to 1, in other words, we want a_1 \cdot a_2 \dots \cdot a_n = 1. For example, for n = 3 and numbers [1, -3, 0] we can make product equal to 1 in 3 coins: add 1 to second element, add 1 to second element again, subtract 1 from third element, so that array becomes [1, -1, -1]. And 1\cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1.What is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?
32	There Are Two Types Of Burgers There are two types of burgers in your restaurant — hamburgers and chicken burgers! To assemble a hamburger you need two buns and a beef patty. To assemble a chicken burger you need two buns and a chicken cutlet. You have b buns, p beef patties and f chicken cutlets in your restaurant. You can sell one hamburger for h dollars and one chicken burger for c dollars. Calculate the maximum profit you can achieve.You have to answer t independent queries.
33	Square Filling You are given two matrices A and B. Each matrix contains exactly n rows and m columns. Each element of A is either 0 or 1; each element of B is initially 0.You may perform some operations with matrix B. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of B having size 2 \times 2, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with 1. In other words, you choose two integers x and y such that 1 \le x < n and 1 \le y < m, and then set B_{x, y}, B_{x, y + 1}, B_{x + 1, y} and B_{x + 1, y + 1} to 1.Your goal is to make matrix B equal to matrix A. Two matrices A and B are equal if and only if every element of matrix A is equal to the corresponding element of matrix B.Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes B equal to A. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
34	Gas Pipeline You are responsible for installing a gas pipeline along a road. Let's consider the road (for simplicity) as a segment [0, n] on OX axis. The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we'll denote each crossroad as an interval (x, x + 1) with integer x. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of n characters, where character  means that current interval doesn't contain a crossroad, and  means that there is a crossroad.Usually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of 1 unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for [0, n] road, we must install n + 1 pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height 2, so the pipeline won't obstruct the way for cars.We can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment [x, x + 1] with integer x consisting of three parts: 0.5 units of horizontal pipe + 1 unit of vertical pipe + 0.5 of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height 2, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to 2 units.Each unit of gas pipeline costs us a bourles, and each unit of pillar — b bourles. So, it's not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height 2. Find the shape of the pipeline with minimum possible cost and calculate that cost.Note that you  start and finish the pipeline on height 1 and, also, it's guaranteed that the first and last characters of the input string are equal to .
35	Number Of Permutations You are given a sequence of n pairs of integers: (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \dots , (a_n, b_n). This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:Calculate the number of permutations of size n such that after applying this permutation to the sequence s it turns into a good sequence. A permutation p of size n is a sequence p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n (1 \le p_i \le n). If you apply permutation p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n to the sequence s_1, s_2, \dots , s_n you get the sequence s_{p_1}, s_{p_2}, \dots , s_{p_n}. For example, if s = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] and p = [2, 3, 1] then s turns into [(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)].
36	XOR Guessing  You may use  in C++,  in Java,  in Python or  in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: .The jury picked an integer x not less than 0 and not greater than 2^{14} - 1. You have to guess this integer.To do so, you may ask no more than 2 queries. Each query should consist of 100 integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{100} (each integer should be not less than 0 and not greater than 2^{14} - 1). In response to your query, the jury will pick one integer i (1 \le i \le 100) and tell you the value of a_i \oplus x (the bitwise XOR of a_i and x). There is an additional constraint on the queries: all 200 integers you use in the queries should be distinct.
37	Remainder Problem You are given an array a consisting of 500000 integers (numbered from 1 to 500000). Initially all elements of a are zero.You have to process two types of queries to this array:Can you process all the queries?
38	XORinacci Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named  numbers. He defined them as follows: You are given three integers a, b, and n, calculate f(n).You have to answer for T independent test cases.
39	Uniqueness You are given an array a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}. You can remove  subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.In other words,  time you can choose two integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n) and delete integers a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct. Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.
40	Magic Grid Let us define a  grid to be a square matrix of integers of size n \times n, satisfying the following conditions. You are given an integer n which is a . Construct a  grid of size n \times n.
41	Restore Permutation An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].There is a hidden permutation of length n.For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.Your task is to restore the permutation.
42	Let Them Slide You are given n arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a table with w columns and n rows. The i-th array is placed horizontally in the i-th row. You can slide each array within its row as long as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the table.You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the j-th column for each j from 1 to w independently.Note that you can exclude any array out of a column provided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be zero.
43	Bits And Pieces You are given an array a of n integers.You need to find the maximum value of a_{i} | ( a_{j} \& a_{k} ) over all triplets (i,j,k) such that i < j < k.Here \& denotes the , and | denotes the .
44	Paint the Numbers You are given a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. You need to paint elements in colors, so that: For example, it's fine to paint elements [40, 10, 60] in a single color, because they are all divisible by 10. You can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use a color only once). The elements painted in one color do not need to be consecutive.For example, if a=[6, 2, 3, 4, 12] then two colors are required: let's paint 6, 3 and 12 in the first color (6, 3 and 12 are divisible by 3) and paint 2 and 4 in the second color (2 and 4 are divisible by 2). For example, if a=[10, 7, 15] then 3 colors are required (we can simply paint each element in an unique color).
45	Koala and Lights It is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns n lights, all of which flash periodically.After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters a_i and b_i. Light with parameters a_i and b_i will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every a_i seconds starting from the b_i-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments b_i, b_i + a_i, b_i + 2 \cdot a_i and so on.You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters a_i and b_i. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.
46	Paint the Digits You are given a sequence of n digits d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:For example, for the sequence d=914 the only valid coloring is 211 (paint in the color 1 two last digits, paint in the color 2 the first digit). But 122 is not a valid coloring (9 concatenated with 14 is not a non-decreasing sequence).It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions.Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.
47	Cow and Snacks The legendary Farmer John is throwing a huge party, and animals from all over the world are hanging out at his house. His guests are hungry, so he instructs his cow Bessie to bring out the snacks! Moo!There are n snacks flavors, numbered with integers 1, 2, \ldots, n. Bessie has n snacks, one snack of each flavor. Every guest has exactly two favorite flavors. The procedure for eating snacks will go as follows:Help Bessie to minimize the number of sad guests by lining the guests in an optimal way.
48	Koala and Notebook Koala Land consists of m bidirectional roads connecting n cities. The roads are numbered from 1 to m by order in input. It is guaranteed, that one can reach any city from every other city.Koala starts traveling from city 1. Whenever he travels on a road, he writes its number down in his notebook. He doesn't put spaces between the numbers, so they all get concatenated into a single number.Before embarking on his trip, Koala is curious about the resulting number for all possible destinations. For each possible destination, what is the smallest number he could have written for it?Since these numbers may be quite large, print their remainders modulo 10^9+7. Please note, that you need to compute the remainder of the minimum possible number,  the minimum possible remainder.
49	Anadi and Domino Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 \leq a \leq b \leq 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?
50	Marcin and Training Camp Marcin is a coach in his university. There are n students who want to attend a training camp. Marcin is a smart coach, so he wants to send only the students that can work calmly with each other.Let's focus on the students. They are indexed with integers from 1 to n. Each of them can be described with two integers a_i and b_i; b_i is equal to the skill level of the i-th student (the higher, the better). Also, there are 60 known algorithms, which are numbered with integers from 0 to 59. If the i-th student knows the j-th algorithm, then the j-th bit (2^j) is set in the binary representation of a_i. Otherwise, this bit is not set.Student x thinks that he is better than student y if and only if x knows some algorithm which y doesn't know. Note that two students can think that they are better than each other. A group of students can work together calmly if no student in this group thinks that he is better than everyone else in this group.Marcin wants to send a group of at least two students which will work together calmly and will have the maximum possible sum of the skill levels. What is this sum?
51	Kamil and Making a Stream Kamil likes streaming the competitive programming videos. His MeTube channel has recently reached 100 million subscribers. In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?You're given a tree — a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices connected by n - 1 edges. The tree is rooted at vertex 1. A vertex u is called an  of v if it lies on the shortest path between the root and v. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.Each vertex v is assigned its  x_v — a non-negative integer not larger than 10^{12}. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let u be an ancestor of v. Then we define the beauty f(u, v) as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between u and v. Formally, if u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_k=v are the vertices on the shortest path between u and v, then f(u, v) = \gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \dots, x_{t_k}). Here, \gcd denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, f(u, u) = \gcd(x_u) = x_u.Your task is to find the sum \sum_{u\text{ is an ancestor of }v} f(u, v). As the result might be too large, please output it modulo 10^9 + 7.Note that for each y, \gcd(0, y) = \gcd(y, 0) = y. In particular, \gcd(0, 0) = 0.
52	Konrad and Company Evaluation Konrad is a Human Relations consultant working for VoltModder, a large electrical equipment producer. Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the level of happiness in the company.There are n people working for VoltModder, numbered from 1 to n. Each employee earns a different amount of money in the company — initially, the i-th person earns i rubles per day.On each of q following days, the salaries will be revised. At the end of the i-th day, employee v_i will start earning n+i rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the company. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again.Some pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological danger in the company. Formally, if two people a and b dislike each other and a earns more money than b, employee a will brag about this to b. A  is a triple of three employees a, b and c, such that a brags to b, who in turn brags to c. If a dislikes b, then b dislikes a.At the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number of  in the company. Can you help him do it?
53	Wojtek and Card Tricks Wojtek has just won a maths competition in Byteland! The prize is admirable — a great book called 'Card Tricks for Everyone.' 'Great!' he thought, 'I can finally use this old, dusted deck of cards that's always been lying unused on my desk!'The first chapter of the book is 'How to Shuffle k Cards in Any Order You Want.' It's basically a list of n intricate methods of shuffling the deck of k cards in a deterministic way. Specifically, the i-th recipe can be described as a permutation (P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, \dots, P_{i,k}) of integers from 1 to k. If we enumerate the cards in the deck from 1 to k from top to bottom, then P_{i,j} indicates the number of the j-th card from the top of the deck after the shuffle.The day is short and Wojtek wants to learn only some of the tricks today. He will pick two integers l, r (1 \le l \le r \le n), and he will memorize each trick from the l-th to the r-th, inclusive. He will then take a sorted deck of k cards and repeatedly apply random memorized tricks until he gets bored. He still likes maths, so he started wondering: how many different decks can he have after he stops shuffling it?Wojtek still didn't choose the integers l and r, but he is still curious. Therefore, he defined f(l, r) as the number of different decks he can get if he memorizes all the tricks between the l-th and the r-th, inclusive. What is the value of\sum_{l=1}^n \sum_{r=l}^n f(l, r)?
54	Chips Moving You are given n chips on a number line. The i-th chip is placed at the integer coordinate x_i. Some chips .You can perform each of the two following types of moves any (possibly, zero) number of times on any chip:Note that it's allowed to move chips to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.Your task is to find the minimum total number of coins required to move all n chips to the same coordinate (i.e. all x_i should be equal after some sequence of moves).
55	Bad Prices Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).Print the number of days with a bad price.You have to answer t independent data sets.
56	Book Reading Polycarp is reading a book consisting of n pages numbered from 1 to n. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by m, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if n=15 and m=5, pages divisible by m are 5, 10, 15. Their last digits are 5, 0, 5 correspondingly, their sum is 10.Your task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down.You have to answer q independent queries.
57	Two Small Strings You are given two strings s and t  and both consisting only of characters '', '' and ''.Possible examples of strings s and t: "", "", "".You have to find a string res consisting of 3n characters, n characters should be '', n characters should be '' and n characters should be '' and s and t should not occur in res as substrings.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, the strings "", "" and "" are substrings of the string "", but the strings "", "" and "" are not substrings of the string "".If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
58	Unstable String Sort Authors have come up with the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary equal) p and q (both of length n). Recall that the permutation is the array of length n which contains each integer from 1 to n exactly once.For all i from 1 to n-1 the following properties hold: s[p_i] \le s[p_{i + 1}] and s[q_i] \le s[q_{i + 1}]. It means that if you will write down all characters of s in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.Your task is to restore  such string s of length n consisting of  which suits the given permutations.If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
59	Optimal Currency Exchange Andrew was very excited to participate in Olympiad of Metropolises. Days flew by quickly, and Andrew is already at the airport, ready to go home. He has n rubles left, and would like to exchange them to euro and dollar bills. Andrew can mix dollar bills and euro bills in whatever way he wants. The price of one dollar is d rubles, and one euro costs e rubles.Recall that there exist the following dollar bills: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and the following euro bills — 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 (note that, in this problem we do  consider the 500 euro bill, it is hard to find such bills in the currency exchange points). Andrew can buy any combination of bills, and his goal is to minimize the total number of rubles he will have after the exchange.Help him — write a program that given integers n, e and d, finds the minimum number of rubles Andrew can get after buying dollar and euro bills.
60	Badges There are b boys and g girls participating in Olympiad of Metropolises. There will be a board games tournament in the evening and n participants have accepted the invitation. The organizers do not know how many boys and girls are among them.Organizers are preparing red badges for girls and blue ones for boys.Vasya prepared n+1 decks of badges. The i-th (where i is from 0 to n, inclusive) deck contains i blue badges and n-i red ones. The total number of badges in any deck is exactly n.Determine the  number of decks among these n+1 that Vasya should take, so that there will be a suitable deck no matter how many girls and boys there will be among the participants of the tournament.
61	Bad Sequence Petya's friends made him a birthday present — a bracket sequence. Petya was quite disappointed with his gift, because he dreamed of correct bracket sequence, yet he told his friends nothing about his dreams and decided to fix present himself. To make everything right, Petya is going to move at most one bracket from its original place in the sequence to any other position. Reversing the bracket (e.g. turning "(" into ")" or vice versa) isn't allowed. We remind that bracket sequence s is called correct if: For example, "", "" are correct, while "" and "" are not. Help Petya to fix his birthday present and understand whether he can move one bracket so that the sequence becomes correct.
62	Treasure Island All of us love treasures, right? That's why young Vasya is heading for a Treasure Island.Treasure Island may be represented as a rectangular table n \times m which is surrounded by the ocean. Let us number rows of the field with consecutive integers from 1 to n from top to bottom and columns with consecutive integers from 1 to m from left to right. Denote the cell in r-th row and c-th column as (r, c). Some of the island cells contain impassable forests, and some cells are free and passable. Treasure is hidden in cell (n, m).Vasya got off the ship in cell (1, 1). Now he wants to reach the treasure. He is hurrying up, so he can move only from cell to the cell in next row (downwards) or next column (rightwards), i.e. from cell (x, y) he can move only to cells (x+1, y) and (x, y+1). Of course Vasya can't move through cells with impassable forests.Evil Witch is aware of Vasya's journey and she is going to prevent him from reaching the treasure. Before Vasya's first move she is able to grow using her evil magic impassable forests in previously free cells. Witch is able to grow a forest in any number of any free cells except cells (1, 1) where Vasya got off his ship and (n, m) where the treasure is hidden.Help Evil Witch by finding out the minimum number of cells she has to turn into impassable forests so that Vasya is no longer able to reach the treasure.
63	Petya and Construction Set It's Petya's birthday party and his friends have presented him a brand new "Electrician-n" construction set, which they are sure he will enjoy as he always does with weird puzzles they give him.Construction set "Electrician-n" consists of 2n - 1 wires and 2n light bulbs. Each bulb has its own unique index that is an integer from 1 to 2n, while all wires look the same and are indistinguishable. In order to complete this construction set one has to use each of the wires to connect two distinct bulbs. We define a  in a completed construction set as a sequence of distinct bulbs of length at least two, such that every two consecutive bulbs in this sequence are directly connected by a wire. Completed construction set configuration is said to be correct if a resulting network of bulbs and wires has a tree structure, i.e. any two distinct bulbs are the endpoints of some chain.Petya was assembling different configurations for several days, and he noticed that sometimes some of the bulbs turn on. After a series of experiments he came up with a conclusion that bulbs indexed 2i and 2i - 1 turn on if the chain connecting them consists of exactly d_i wires. Moreover, the following  condition holds: the value of d_i is never greater than n.Petya did his best but was not able to find a configuration that makes all bulbs to turn on, so he seeks your assistance. Please, find out a configuration that makes all bulbs shine. It is guaranteed that such configuration always exists.
64	Employment Two large companies "Cecsi" and "Poca Pola" are fighting against each other for a long time. In order to overcome their competitor, "Poca Pola" started a super secret project, for which it has total n vacancies in all of their offices. After many tests and interviews n candidates were selected and the only thing left was their employment.Because all candidates have the same skills, it doesn't matter where each of them will work. That is why the company decided to distribute candidates between workplaces so that the total distance between home and workplace over all candidates is minimal.It is well known that Earth is round, so it can be described as a circle, and all m cities on Earth can be described as points on this circle. All cities are enumerated from 1 to m so that for each i (1 \le i \le m - 1) cities with indexes i and i + 1 are neighbors and cities with indexes 1 and m are neighbors as well. People can move only along the circle. The distance between any two cities equals to minimal number of transitions between neighboring cities you have to perform to get from one city to another. In particular, the distance between the city and itself equals 0.The "Poca Pola" vacancies are located at offices in cities a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. The candidates live in cities b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n. It is possible that some vacancies are located in the same cities and some candidates live in the same cities. The "Poca Pola" managers are too busy with super secret project, so you were asked to help "Poca Pola" to distribute candidates between workplaces, so that the sum of the distance between home and workplace over all candidates is minimum possible.
65	Yellow Cards The final match of the Berland Football Cup has been held recently. The referee has shown n yellow cards throughout the match. At the beginning of the match there were a_1 players in the first team and a_2 players in the second team.The rules of sending players off the game are a bit different in Berland football. If a player from the first team receives k_1 yellow cards throughout the match, he can no longer participate in the match — he's sent off. And if a player from the second team receives k_2 yellow cards, he's sent off. After a player leaves the match, he can no longer receive any yellow cards. Each of n yellow cards was shown to exactly one player. Even if all players from one team (or even from both teams) leave the match, the game still continues.The referee has lost his records on who has received each yellow card. Help him to determine the minimum and the maximum number of players that could have been thrown out of the game.
66	The Number of Products You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i \ne 0). You have to calculate two following values:
67	Swap Letters Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "" and "". Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.
68	Ticket Game Monocarp and Bicarp live in Berland, where every bus ticket consists of n digits (n is an even number). During the evening walk Monocarp and Bicarp found a ticket where some of the digits have been erased. .Monocarp and Bicarp have decided to play a game with this ticket. Monocarp hates happy tickets, while Bicarp collects them. A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first \frac{n}{2} digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last \frac{n}{2} digits.Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from 0 to 9. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins. You have to determine who will win if both players play optimally.
69	Marbles Monocarp has arranged n colored marbles in a row. The color of the i-th marble is a_i. Monocarp likes ordered things, so he wants to rearrange marbles in such a way that all marbles of the same color form a contiguos segment (and there is only one such segment for each color). In other words, Monocarp wants to rearrange marbles so that, for every color j, if the leftmost marble of color j is l-th in the row, and the rightmost marble of this color has position r in the row, then every marble from l to r has color j.To achieve his goal, Monocarp can do the following operation any number of times: choose two neighbouring marbles, and swap them.You have to calculate the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to rearrange the marbles. Note that the order of segments of marbles having equal color does not matter, it is only required that, for every color, all the marbles of this color form exactly one contiguous segment.
70	Radio Stations In addition to complaints about lighting, a lot of complaints about insufficient radio signal covering has been received by Bertown city hall recently. n complaints were sent to the mayor, all of which are suspiciosly similar to each other: in the i-th complaint, one of the radio fans has mentioned that the signals of two radio stations x_i and y_i are not covering some parts of the city, and demanded that the signal of  of these stations can be received in the whole city.Of cousre, the mayor of Bertown is currently working to satisfy these complaints. A new radio tower has been installed in Bertown, it can transmit a signal with any integer power from 1 to M (let's denote the signal power as f). The mayor has decided that he will choose a set of radio stations and establish a contract with every chosen station. To establish a contract with the i-th station, the following conditions should be met:All this information was already enough for the mayor to realise that choosing the stations is hard. But after consulting with specialists, he learned that some stations the signals of some stations may interfere with each other: there are m pairs of stations (u_i, v_i) that use the same signal frequencies, and for each such pair it is impossible to establish contracts with both stations. .The mayor finds it really hard to analyze this situation, so he hired you to help him. You have to choose signal power f and a set of stations to establish contracts with such that:
71	Prefixes Nikolay got a string s of  length n, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters '' and ''. Its positions are numbered from 1 to n.He wants to modify his string so that every its prefix of  length has an equal amount of letters '' and ''. To achieve that, Nikolay can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose some position in his string and replace the letter on this position with the other letter (i.e. replace '' with '' or replace '' with ''). Nikolay can use no letters except '' and ''.The prefix of string s of length l (1 \le l \le n) is a string s[1..l].For example, for the string s="abba" there are two prefixes of the even length. The first is s[1\dots2]="ab" and the second s[1\dots4]="abba". Both of them have the same number of '' and ''.Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string s to modify it so that every its prefix of  length has an equal amount of letters '' and ''.
72	Shooting Recently Vasya decided to improve his pistol shooting skills. Today his coach offered him the following exercise. He placed n cans in a row on a table. Cans are numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Vasya has to knock down each can exactly once to finish the exercise. He is allowed to choose  in which he will knock the cans down.Vasya knows that the  of the i-th can is a_i. It means that if Vasya has already knocked x cans down and is now about to start shooting the i-th one, he will need (a_i \cdot x + 1) shots to knock it down. You can assume that if Vasya starts shooting the i-th can, he will be shooting it until he knocks it down.Your task is to choose such an order of shooting so that the number of shots required to knock each of the n given cans down exactly once is minimum possible.
73	White Sheet There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates (0, 0), and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates (x_1, y_1), and the top right — (x_2, y_2).After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are (x_3, y_3), and the top right — (x_4, y_4). Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are (x_5, y_5), and the top right — (x_6, y_6). Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying  the white sheet and  of both black sheets.
74	Swords There were n types of swords in the theater basement which had been used during the plays. Moreover there were  x swords of each type. y people have broken into the theater basement and each of them has taken exactly z swords of some . Note that different people might have taken different types of swords. Note that the values x, y and z are unknown for you.The next morning the director of the theater discovers the loss. He counts all swords — exactly a_i swords of the i-th type are left untouched.The director has no clue about the initial number of swords of each type in the basement, the number of people who have broken into the basement and how many swords each of them have taken.For example, if n=3, a = [3, 12, 6] then one of the possible situations is x=12, y=5 and z=3. Then the first three people took swords of the first type and the other two people took swords of the third type. Note that you don't know values x, y and z beforehand but know values of n and a.Thus he seeks for your help. Determine the  number of people y, which could have broken into the theater basement, and the number of swords z each of them has taken.
75	Wi-Fi You work as a system administrator in a dormitory, which has n rooms one after another along a straight hallway. Rooms are numbered from 1 to n.You have to connect all n rooms to the Internet.You can connect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for the i-th room is i coins. Some rooms also have a spot for a router. The cost of placing a router in the i-th room is also i coins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it. When you place a router in the room i, you connect all rooms with the numbers from max(1,~i - k) to min(n,~i + k) inclusive to the Internet, where k is the range of router. The value of k is the same for all routers. Calculate the minimum total cost of connecting all n rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.
76	Creating a Character You play your favourite game yet another time. You chose the character you didn't play before. It has str points of strength and int points of intelligence. Also, at start, the character has exp free experience points you can invest either in strength or in intelligence (by investing one point you can either raise strength by 1 or raise intelligence by 1).Since you'd like to make some fun you want to create a jock character, so it has more strength than intelligence points (resulting strength is  than the resulting intelligence).Calculate the number of different character builds you can create (for the purpose of replayability) if you must . Two character builds are different if their strength and/or intellect are different.
77	Zmei Gorynich You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! Initially Zmei Gorynich has x heads. You can deal n types of blows. If you deal a blow of the i-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by min(d_i, curX), there curX is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows h_i new heads. If curX = 0 then Gorynich is defeated. For example, if curX = 10, d = 7, h = 10 then the number of heads changes to 13 (you cut 7 heads off, but then Zmei grows 10 new ones), but if curX = 10, d = 11, h = 100 then number of heads changes to 0 and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!You have to answer t independent queries.
78	The Number Of Good Substrings You are given a binary string s (recall that a string is binary if each character is either 0 or 1).Let f(t) be the decimal representation of integer t written in binary form (possibly with leading zeroes). For example f(011) = 3, f(00101) = 5, f(00001) = 1, f(10) = 2, f(000) = 0 and f(000100) = 4.The substring s_{l}, s_{l+1}, \dots , s_{r} is good if r - l + 1 = f(s_l \dots s_r).For example string s = 1011 has 5 good substrings: s_1 \dots s_1 = 1, s_3 \dots s_3 = 1, s_4 \dots s_4 = 1, s_1 \dots s_2 = 10 and s_2 \dots s_4 = 011. Your task is to calculate the number of good substrings of string s.You have to answer t independent queries.
79	Coloring Edges You are given a directed graph with n vertices and m directed edges without self-loops or multiple edges.Let's denote the k-coloring of a digraph as following: you color each edge in one of k colors. The k-coloring is  if and only if there no cycle formed by edges of same color.Find a good k-coloring of given digraph with minimum possible k.
80	Sum Queries? Let's define a  multiset the following way. Write down the sum of all elements of the multiset in its decimal representation. For each position of that number check if the multiset includes at least one element such that the digit of the element and the digit of the sum at that position are the same. If that holds for every position, then the multiset is . Otherwise it's .For example, multiset \{20, 300, 10001\} is  and multiset \{20, 310, 10001\} is : The red digits mark the elements and the positions for which these elements have the same digit as the sum. The sum of the first multiset is 10321, every position has the digit required. The sum of the second multiset is 10331 and the second-to-last digit doesn't appear in any number, thus making the multiset .You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, consisting of n integers.You are asked to perform some queries on it. The queries can be of two types:Note that the empty multiset is .For each query of the second type print the lowest sum of the  subset. Print  if no  subset exists.
81	Forced Online Queries Problem You are given an undirected graph with n vertices numbered from 1 to n. Initially there are no edges.You are asked to perform some queries on the graph. Let last be the answer to the latest query of the second type, it is set to 0 before the first such query. Then the queries are the following:Good luck!
82	BubbleReactor You are in charge of the BubbleReactor. It consists of N BubbleCores connected with N lines of electrical wiring. Each electrical wiring connects two distinct BubbleCores. There are no BubbleCores connected with more than one line of electrical wiring.Your task is to start the BubbleReactor by starting each BubbleCore. In order for a BubbleCore to be started it needs to be receiving power from a directly connected BubbleCore which is already started. However, you can kick-start one BubbleCore manually without needing power. It is guaranteed that all BubbleCores can be started.Before the BubbleCore boot up procedure its potential is calculated as the number of BubbleCores it can power on (the number of inactive BubbleCores which are connected to it directly or with any number of inactive BubbleCores in between, itself included)Start the BubbleReactor so that the sum of all BubbleCores' potentials is maximum.
83	Guarding warehouses Bob Bubblestrong just got a new job as security guard. Bob is now responsible for safety of a collection of warehouses, each containing the most valuable Bubble Cup assets - the high-quality bubbles. His task is to detect thieves inside the warehouses and call the police.Looking from the sky, each warehouse has a shape of a convex polygon. Walls of no two warehouses intersect, and of course, none of the warehouses is built inside of another warehouse.Little did the Bubble Cup bosses know how lazy Bob is and that he enjoys watching soap operas (he heard they are full of bubbles) from the coziness of his office. Instead of going from one warehouse to another to check if warehouses are secured, the plan Bob has is to monitor all the warehouses from the comfort of his office using the special X-ray goggles. The goggles have an infinite range, so a thief in any of the warehouses could easily be spotted.However, the goggles promptly broke and the X-rays are now strong only enough to let Bob see through a single wall. Now, Bob would really appreciate if you could help him find out what is the total area inside of the warehouses monitored by the broken goggles, so that he could know how much area of the warehouses he needs to monitor in person.
84	Jumping Transformers You, the mighty Blackout, are standing in the upper-left (0,0) corner of NxM matrix. You must move either right or down each second. There are K transformers jumping around the matrix in the following way. Each transformer starts jumping from position (x,y), at time t, and jumps to the next position each second. The x-axes grows downwards, and y-axes grows to the right. The order of jumping positions is defined as {(x,y),(x+d,y-d),(x+d,y),(x,y+d)}, and is periodic. Before time t transformer is not in the matrix.You want to arrive to the bottom-right corner (N-1,M-1), while slaying transformers and losing the least possible amount of energy. When you meet the transformer (or more of them) in the matrix field, you must kill them all, and you lose the sum of the energy amounts required to kill each transformer.After the transformer is killed, he of course stops jumping, falls into the abyss and leaves the matrix world. Output minimum possible amount of energy wasted.
85	Xor Spanning Tree In the galaxy far far away is the ancient interplanetary republic of Bubbleland, consisting of N planets. Between them, there are M bidirectional wormholes, each connecting a pair of planets. Bubbleland is a very centralized republic, having a capital planet Whiteplanet, from which any another planet can be reached using these wormholes. It is also guaranteed that no wormhole connects planet to itself and that no two different wormholes connect same pair of planets. We call a path that begins at one planet, visits other planets and each of them at most once and returns to starting point a . Interplanetary Safety Regulations guarantee that each planet belongs to at most one  and that there are at most 42 .After many eons of usage, wormholes need to be repaired and each wormhole has the cost W_{i} which needs to be payed for reparation. Unfortunately, the Senate of Bubbleland is short on budget. Therefore, they have decided only to fix as many wormholes as they need in order to have all planets reachable from capital and to pay as little money as they have to for this repair. However the way in which the Senate calculates the cost is different. Cost of the set of reparations is binary xor of costs of each individual reparation, that is if reparations to be made have costs A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{k}, the cost of entire set is A_{1} \oplus A_{2} \oplus ... \oplus A_{k}.Now the Senate would like to know how much money do they have to pay and also the number of different ways to achieve that cost .
86	Product Tuples While roaming the mystic areas of Stonefalls, in order to drop legendary loot, an adventurer was given a quest as follows. He was given an array A = {a_1,a_2,...,a_N } of length N, and a number K.Define array B as B(q, A) =  { q-a_1, q-a_2, ..., q-a_N }. Define function F as F(B,K) being sum of products of all K-tuples of elements in array B. For example, if the array B is [2,3,4,5], and with K=3, sum of products of all 3-tuples is F(B, 3) = 2*3*4+2*3*5+3*4*5+2*4*5He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types: All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries. Help the adventurer calculate the answer to a quest, and finally get that loot!
87	Workout plan Alan decided to get in shape for the summer, so he created a precise workout plan to follow. His plan is to go to a different gym every day during the next N days and lift X[i] grams on day i. In order to improve his workout performance at the gym, he can buy exactly one pre-workout drink at the gym he is currently in and it will improve his performance by A grams permanently and immediately. In different gyms these pre-workout drinks can cost different amounts C[i] because of the taste and the gym's location but its permanent workout gains are the same. Before the first day of starting his workout plan, Alan knows he can lift a maximum of K grams. Help Alan spend a minimum total amount of money in order to reach his workout plan. If there is no way for him to complete his workout plan successfully output -1.
88	Periodic integer number Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive X integer number is periodic with length L if there exists positive integer number P with L digits such that X can be written as PPPP…P. For example:X = 123123123 is periodic number with length L = 3 and L = 9X = 42424242 is periodic number with length L = 2,L = 4 and L = 8X = 12345 is periodic number with length L = 5For given positive period length L and positive integer number A, Alice wants to find smallest integer number X strictly greater than A that is periodic with length L.
89	Cards When Serezha was three years old, he was given a set of cards with letters for his birthday. They were arranged into words in the way which formed the boy's mother favorite number in binary notation. Serezha started playing with them immediately and shuffled them because he wasn't yet able to read. His father decided to rearrange them. Help him restore the original number, on condition that it was the maximum possible one. 
90	Multiplication Table Sasha grew up and went to first grade. To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table M with n rows and n columns such that M_{ij}=a_i \cdot a_j where a_1, \dots, a_n is some sequence of positive integers.Of course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array a_1, \dots, a_n. Help Sasha restore the array!
91	Substring Game in the Lesson Mike and Ann are sitting in the classroom. The lesson is boring, so they decided to play an interesting game. Fortunately, all they need to play this game is a string s and a number k (0 \le k < |s|).At the beginning of the game, players are given a substring of s with left border l and right border r, both equal to k (i.e. initially l=r=k). Then players start to make moves one by one, according to the following rules:Recall that a substring s[l, r] (l \le r) of a string s is a continuous segment of letters from s that starts at position l and ends at position r. For example, "" is a substring (s[3, 5]) of "" and "" is not.Mike and Ann were playing so enthusiastically that they did not notice the teacher approached them. Surprisingly, the teacher didn't scold them, instead of that he said, that he can figure out the winner of the game before it starts, even if he knows only s and k.Unfortunately, Mike and Ann are not so keen in the game theory, so they ask you to write a program, that takes s and determines the winner for all possible k.
92	Alex and Julian Boy Dima gave Julian a birthday present — set B consisting of positive integers. However, he didn't know, that Julian hates sets, but enjoys bipartite graphs more than anything else!Julian was almost upset, but her friend Alex said, that he can build an undirected graph using this set in such a way: let all integer numbers be vertices, then connect any two i and j with an edge if |i - j| belongs to B.Unfortunately, Julian doesn't like the graph, that was built using B. Alex decided to rectify the situation, so he wants to erase some numbers from B, so that graph built using the new set is bipartite. The difficulty of this task is that the graph, Alex has to work with, has an infinite number of vertices and edges! It is impossible to solve this task alone, so Alex asks you for help. Write a program that erases a subset of  size from B so that graph constructed on the new set is bipartite.Recall, that graph is bipartite if all its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from different sets.
93	Tourism Alex decided to go on a touristic trip over the country.For simplicity let's assume that the country has n cities and m bidirectional roads connecting them. Alex lives in city s and initially located in it. To compare different cities Alex assigned each city a score w_i which is as high as interesting city seems to Alex.Alex believes that his trip will be interesting only if he will not use any road twice in a row. That is if Alex came to city v from city u, he may choose as the next city in the trip any city connected with v by the road, except for the city u.Your task is to help Alex plan his city in a way that maximizes total score over all cities he visited. Note that for each city its score is counted at most once, even if Alex been there several times during his trip.
94	Gardener Alex Gardener Alex loves to grow trees. We remind that tree is a connected acyclic graph on n vertices. Today he decided to grow a rooted binary tree. A binary tree is a tree where any vertex has no more than two sons. Luckily, Alex has a permutation of numbers from 1 to n which he was presented at his last birthday, so he decided to grow a tree according to this permutation. To do so he does the following process: he finds a minimum element and makes it a root of the tree. After that permutation is divided into two parts: everything that is to the left of the minimum element, and everything that is to the right. The minimum element on the left part becomes the left son of the root, and the minimum element on the right part becomes the right son of the root. After that, this process is repeated recursively on both parts.Now Alex wants to grow a forest of trees: one tree for each cyclic shift of the permutation. He is interested in what cyclic shift gives the tree of minimum depth. Unfortunately, growing a forest is a hard and long process, but Alex wants the answer right now. Will you help him?We remind that cyclic shift of permutation a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, \ldots, a_n for k elements to the left is the permutation a_{k + 1}, a_{k + 2}, \ldots, a_n, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k.
95	2048 Game You are playing a variation of game . Initially you have a multiset s of n integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.During each operation you choose two  integers from s, remove them from s and insert the number equal to their sum into s.For example, if s = \{1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2\} and you choose integers 2 and 2, then the multiset becomes \{1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2\}.You win if the number 2048 belongs to your multiset. For example, if s = \{1024, 512, 512, 4\} you can win as follows: choose 512 and 512, your multiset turns into \{1024, 1024, 4\}. Then choose 1024 and 1024, your multiset turns into \{2048, 4\} and you win.You have to determine if you can win this game.You have to answer q independent queries.
96	Knights You are given a chess board with n rows and n columns. Initially all cells of the board are empty, and you have to put a white or a black knight into each cell of the board.A knight is a chess piece that can attack a piece in cell (x_2, y_2) from the cell (x_1, y_1) if one of the following conditions is met:Here are some examples of which cells knight can attack. In each of the following pictures, if the knight is currently in the blue cell, it can attack all red cells (and only them).A  is a pair of knights of  colors such that these knights attack each other. You have to put a knight (a white one or a black one) into each cell in such a way that the number of duels is maximum possible.
97	Perfect Team You may have already known that a standard ICPC team consists of exactly three members. The perfect team however has more restrictions. A student can have some specialization: coder or mathematician. So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one coder, at least one mathematician and it consists of exactly three members.You are a coach at a very large university and you know that c of your students are coders, m are mathematicians and x have no specialization.What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into? Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team.You are also asked to answer q independent queries.
98	Make The Fence Great Again You have a fence consisting of n vertical boards. The width of each board is 1. The height of the i-th board is a_i. You think that the fence is  if there is no pair of adjacent boards having the same height. More formally, the fence is great if and only if for all indices from 2 to n, the condition a_{i-1} \neq a_i holds.Unfortunately, it is possible that now your fence is not great. But you can change it! You can increase the length of the i-th board by 1, but you have to pay b_i rubles for it. The length of each board can be increased any number of times (possibly, zero).Calculate the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make the fence great again!You have to answer q independent queries.
99	Game With String Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n, consisting of only characters  and . They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters  and replaces each of them with . Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.For example, if s =  and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into . And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = , then after Bob's move the string can turn into ,  or .Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.You have to answer q independent queries.
100	Choose a Square Petya recently found a game "Choose a Square". In this game, there are n points numbered from 1 to n on an infinite field. The i-th point has coordinates (x_i, y_i) and cost c_i.You have to choose a square such that its sides are parallel to coordinate axes, the lower left and upper right corners belong to the line y = x, and all corners have integer coordinates.The score you get is the sum of costs of the points covered by the selected square minus the length of the side of the square. Note that the length of the side can be zero.Petya asks you to calculate the maximum possible score in the game that can be achieved by placing exactly one square.
101	CME Let's denote  (we will denote it as CME) an equation a + b = c there all integers a, b and c are greater than zero.For example, equations 2 + 2 = 4 () and 1 + 2 = 3 () are CME but equations 1 + 2 = 4 (), 2 + 2 = 3 (), and 0 + 1 = 1 () are not.Now, you have n matches. You want to assemble a CME using  your matches. Unfortunately, it is possible that you can't assemble the CME using all matches. But you can buy some extra matches and then assemble CME!For example, if n = 2, you can buy two matches and assemble , and if n = 5 you can buy one match and assemble . Calculate the minimum number of matches which you have to buy for assembling CME.Note, that you have to answer q independent queries.
102	Strings Equalization You are given two strings of equal length s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations on these strings.During each operation you choose two  characters in  string and assign the value of the first character to the value of the second or vice versa.For example, if s is "" you can get the following strings in  operation: Note that you can also apply this operation to the string t.Please determine whether it is possible to transform s into t, applying the operation above any number of times.Note that you have to answer q independent queries.
103	Save the Nature You are an environmental activist at heart but the reality is harsh and you are just a cashier in a cinema. But you can still do something!You have n tickets to sell. The price of the i-th ticket is p_i. As a teller, you have a possibility to select the order in which the tickets will be sold (i.e. a permutation of the tickets). You know that the cinema participates in two ecological restoration programs applying them :If the ticket is in both programs then the (x + y) \% are used for environmental activities. Also, it's known that all prices are multiples of 100, so there is no need in any rounding.For example, if you'd like to sell tickets with prices [400, 100, 300, 200] and the cinema pays 10\% of each 2-nd sold ticket and 20\% of each 3-rd sold ticket, then arranging them in order [100, 200, 300, 400] will lead to contribution equal to 100 \cdot 0 + 200 \cdot 0.1 + 300 \cdot 0.2 + 400 \cdot 0.1 = 120. But arranging them in order [100, 300, 400, 200] will lead to 100 \cdot 0 + 300 \cdot 0.1 + 400 \cdot 0.2 + 200 \cdot 0.1 = 130.Nature can't wait, so you decided to change the order of tickets in such a way, so that the  contribution to programs will reach at least k in  number of sold tickets. Or say that it's impossible to do so. In other words, find the minimum number of tickets which are needed to be sold in order to earn at least k.
104	Sequence Sorting You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, consisting of integers.You can apply the following operation to this sequence: choose some integer x and move  elements equal to x either to the beginning, or to the end of a. Note that you have to move all these elements in  direction in  operation.For example, if a = [2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2], you can get the following sequences in one operation (for convenience, denote elements equal to x as x-elements): You have to determine the minimum number of such operations so that the sequence a becomes sorted in non-descending order. Non-descending order means that for all i from 2 to n, the condition a_{i-1} \le a_i is satisfied.Note that you have to answer q independent queries.
105	Paint the Tree You are given a weighted tree consisting of n vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices u_i and v_i are connected by an edge with weight w_i.Let's define the k-coloring of the tree as an assignment of exactly k colors to  vertex, so that each color is used no more than two times. You can assume that you have infinitely many colors available. We say that an edge is  in the given k-coloring if its endpoints share at least one color (i.e. there exists a color that is assigned to both endpoints).Let's also define the  of a k-coloring as the sum of weights of  edges.Please calculate the maximum possible  of a k-coloring of the given tree.You have to answer q independent queries.
106	Stack Exterminable Arrays Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array s of the length l. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. If after this process the stack remains empty, the array s is considered .There are samples of stack exterminable arrays: Let's consider the changing of stack more details if s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5] (the top of stack is highlighted). You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.Note, that you have to answer q independent queries.
107	Forgetting Things Kolya is very absent-minded. Today his math teacher asked him to solve a simple problem with the equation a + 1 = b with positive integers a and b, but Kolya forgot the numbers a and b. He does, however, remember that the first (leftmost) digit of a was d_a, and the first (leftmost) digit of b was d_b.Can you reconstruct any equation a + 1 = b that satisfies this property? It may be possible that Kolya misremembers the digits, and there is no suitable equation, in which case report so.
108	p-binary Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented  of the form 2^x + p, where x is a  integer.For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).
109	Power Products You are given n positive integers a_1, \ldots, a_n, and an integer k \geq 2. Count the number of pairs i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq n, and there exists an integer x such that a_i \cdot a_j = x^k.
110	Rock Is Push You are at the top left cell (1, 1) of an n \times m labyrinth. Your goal is to get to the bottom right cell (n, m). You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell (x, y) takes you to the cell (x, y + 1), while moving down takes you to the cell (x + 1, y).Some cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.The labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.Count the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo 10^9 + 7. Two paths are considered different if there is at least one cell that is visited in one path, but not visited in the other.
111	Tree Factory Bytelandian Tree Factory produces trees for all kinds of industrial applications. You have been tasked with optimizing the production of a certain type of tree for an especially large and important order.The tree in question is a rooted tree with n vertices labelled with distinct integers from 0 to n - 1. The vertex labelled 0 is the root of the tree, and for any non-root vertex v the label of its parent p(v) is less than the label of v.All trees at the factory are made from bamboo blanks. A  is a rooted tree such that each vertex has exactly one child, except for a single leaf vertex with no children. The vertices of a bamboo blank can be labelled arbitrarily before its processing is started.To process a bamboo into another tree a single type of operation can be made: choose an arbitrary non-root vertex v such that its parent p(v) is not a root either. The operation consists of changing the parent of v to its parent's parent p(p(v)). Note that parents of all other vertices remain unchanged, in particular, the subtree of v does not change.Efficiency is crucial, hence you have to minimize the number of operations to make the desired tree from a bamboo blank. Construct any optimal sequence of operations to produce the desired tree.Note that the labelling of the resulting tree has to coincide with the labelling of the desired tree. Formally, the labels of the roots have to be equal, and for non-root vertices with the same label the labels of their parents should be the same.It is guaranteed that for any test present in this problem an answer exists, and further, an optimal sequence contains at most 10^6 operations. Note that .
112	Math Problem Your math teacher gave you the following problem:There are n segments on the x-axis, [l_1; r_1], [l_2; r_2], \ldots, [l_n; r_n]. The segment [l; r] includes the bounds, i.e. it is a set of such x that l \le x \le r. The length of the segment [l; r] is equal to r - l.Two segments [a; b] and [c; d] have a common point (intersect) if there exists x that a \leq x \leq b and c \leq x \leq d. For example, [2; 5] and [3; 10] have a common point, but [5; 6] and [1; 4] don't have.You should add one segment, which has at least one common point with each of the given segments and as short as possible (i.e. has minimal length). The required segment can degenerate to be a point (i.e a segment with length zero). The added segment may or may not be among the given n segments.In other words, you need to find a segment [a; b], such that [a; b] and every [l_i; r_i] have a common point for each i, and b-a is minimal.
113	Box  p is a sequence of integers p=[p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n], consisting of n distinct (unique) positive integers between 1 and n, inclusive. For example, the following sequences are permutations: [3, 4, 1, 2], [1], [1, 2]. The following sequences are not permutations: [0], [1, 2, 1], [2, 3], [0, 1, 2].The important key is in the locked box that you need to open. To open the box you need to enter secret code. Secret code is a permutation p of length n. You don't know this permutation, you only know the array q of prefix maximums of this permutation. Formally:You want to construct any possible suitable permutation (i.e. any such permutation, that calculated q for this permutation is equal to the given array).
114	Messy You are fed up with your messy room, so you decided to clean it up.Your room is a bracket sequence s=s_{1}s_{2}\dots s_{n} of length n. Each character of this string is either an opening bracket '' or a closing bracket ''.In one operation you can choose any consecutive substring of s and reverse it. In other words, you can choose any substring s[l \dots r]=s_l, s_{l+1}, \dots, s_r and change the order of elements in it into s_r, s_{r-1}, \dots, s_{l}.For example, if you will decide to reverse substring s[2 \dots 4] of string s="" it will be equal to s="".A  (aka balanced) bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '' and '' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "", "" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "", ""), and "" and "" are not.A prefix of a string s is a substring that starts at position 1. For example, for s="" there are 6 prefixes: "", "", "", "", "" and "".In your opinion, a neat and clean room s is a bracket sequence that:For example, if k = 2, then "" is a neat and clean room.You want to use at most n operations to make your room neat and clean. Operations are applied one after another sequentially.It is guaranteed that the answer exists. Note that you  to minimize the number of operations: find any way to achieve the desired configuration in n or less operations.
115	Arson In Berland Forest The Berland Forest can be represented as an infinite cell plane. Every cell contains a tree. That is, contained before the recent events.A destructive fire raged through the Forest, and several trees were damaged by it. Precisely speaking, you have a n \times m rectangle map which represents the damaged part of the Forest. The damaged trees were marked as "" while the remaining ones were marked as "". The firemen quickly extinguished the fire, and now they are investigating the cause of it. The main version is that there was an arson: at some moment of time (let's consider it as 0) some trees were set on fire. At the beginning of minute 0, only the trees that were set on fire initially were burning. At the end of each minute, the fire spread from every burning tree to each of 8 neighboring trees. At the beginning of minute T, the fire was extinguished.The firemen want to find the arsonists as quickly as possible. The problem is, they know neither the value of T (how long the fire has been raging) nor the coordinates of the trees that were initially set on fire. They want you to find the maximum value of T (to know how far could the arsonists escape) and a possible set of trees that could be initially set on fire.Note that you'd like to maximize value T but the set of trees can be arbitrary.
116	Distinct Digits You have two integers l and r. Find an integer x which satisfies the conditions below:If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
117	Filling the Grid Suppose there is a h \times w grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:In other words, the i-th row starts exactly with r_i full cells. Similarly, the j-th column starts exactly with c_j full cells.You have values of r and c. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of r and c. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7). In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by 1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7).
118	Primes and Multiplication Let's introduce some definitions that will be needed later.Let prime(x) be the set of prime divisors of x. For example, prime(140) = \{ 2, 5, 7 \}, prime(169) = \{ 13 \}.Let g(x, p) be the maximum possible integer p^k where k is an integer such that x is divisible by p^k. For example:Let f(x, y) be the product of g(y, p) for all p in prime(x). For example:You have integers x and n. Calculate f(x, 1) \cdot f(x, 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot f(x, n) \bmod{(10^{9} + 7)}.
119	Complete Tripartite You have a simple undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. The graph doesn't contain self-loops, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices. The given graph can be disconnected.Let's make a definition.Let v_1 and v_2 be two some nonempty subsets of vertices that do not intersect. Let f(v_{1}, v_{2}) be true if and only if all the conditions are satisfied:Create three vertex sets (v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}) which satisfy the conditions below;Is it possible to create such three vertex sets? If it's possible, print matching vertex set for each vertex.
120	Another Filling the Grid You have n \times n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).
121	One Node is Gone You have an integer n. Let's define following tree generation as :You have a tree. Determine if this tree can be made by McDic's generation. If yes, then find the parent vertex of removed vertex in tree.
122	Mateusz and Escape Room Mateusz likes to travel! However, on his 42nd visit to Saint Computersburg there is not much left to sightsee. That's why he decided to go to an escape room with his friends!The team has solved all riddles flawlessly. There is only one riddle remaining — a huge circular table! There are n weighing scales lying on top of the table, distributed along the circle. Each scale is adjacent to exactly two other scales: for each i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n-1\}, the i-th and the (i+1)-th scales are adjacent to each other, as well as the first and the n-th scale.The i-th scale initially contains a_i heavy coins. Mateusz can perform moves — each move consists of fetching a single coin from one scale and putting it on any adjacent scale.It turns out that the riddle will be solved when there is a specific amount of coins on each of the scales. Specifically, each scale has parameters l_i and r_i. If each coin lies on a single scale and for each i, the i-th scale contains at least l_i and at most r_i coins, the riddle will be solved and Mateusz's team will win!Mateusz is aiming for the best possible time. Therefore, he wants to solved the riddle as quickly as possible. What is the minimum possible number of moves required to fulfill all the conditions?
123	Dawid and Bags of Candies Dawid has four bags of candies. The i-th of them contains a_i candies. Also, Dawid has two friends. He wants to give each bag to one of his two friends. Is it possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies in total?Note, that you can't keep bags for yourself or throw them away, each bag should be given to one of the friends.
124	Ania and Minimizing Ania has a large integer S. Its decimal representation has length n and doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Ania is allowed to change at most k digits of S. She wants to do it in such a way that S still won't contain any leading zeroes and it'll be minimal possible. What integer will Ania finish with?
125	Increasing Matrix In this problem, a n \times m rectangular matrix a is called  if, for each row of i, when go from left to right, the values strictly increase (that is, a_{i,1}<a_{i,2}<\dots<a_{i,m}) and for each column j, when go from top to bottom, the values strictly increase (that is, a_{1,j}<a_{2,j}<\dots<a_{n,j}).In a given matrix of non-negative integers, it is necessary to replace each value of 0 with some positive integer so that the resulting matrix is increasing and the sum of its elements is maximum, or find that it is impossible.It is guaranteed that in a given value matrix all values of 0 are contained only in internal cells (that is, not in the first or last row and not in the first or last column).
126	Middle-Out You are given two strings s and t of the same length n. Their characters are numbered from 1 to n from left to right (i.e. from the beginning to the end).In a single move you can do the following sequence of actions:Note, that the moves don't change the length of the string s. You can apply a move only to the string s.For example, if s="" in one move you can obtain:You want to make the string s equal to the string t. What is the minimum number of moves you need? If it is impossible to transform s to t, print .
127	Equalize Prices Again You are both a shop keeper and a shop assistant at a small nearby shop. You have n goods, the i-th good costs a_i coins.You got tired of remembering the price of each product when customers ask for it, thus you decided to simplify your life. More precisely you decided to set the same price for all n goods you have.However, you don't want to lose any money so you want to choose the price in such a way that the sum of new prices is not less than the sum of the initial prices. It means that if you sell all n goods for the new price, you will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial prices.On the other hand, you don't want to lose customers because of big prices so among all prices you can choose you need to choose the minimum one.So you need to find the minimum possible equal price of all n goods so if you sell them for this price, you will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial prices.You have to answer q independent queries.
128	Pipes You are given a system of pipes. It consists of two rows, each row consists of n pipes. The top left pipe has the coordinates (1, 1) and the bottom right — (2, n).There are six types of pipes: two types of straight pipes and four types of curved pipes. Here are the examples of all six types:You can turn each of the given pipes 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise  (so the types 1 and 2 can become each other and types 3, 4, 5, 6 can become each other).You want to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can start at (1, 0) (to the left of the top left pipe), move to the pipe at (1, 1), flow somehow by  to the pipe at (2, n) and flow right to (2, n + 1).Pipes are connected if they are adjacent in the system and their ends are connected. Here are examples of connected pipes:Let's describe the problem using some example:And its solution is below: As you can see, the water flow is the poorly drawn blue line. To obtain the answer, we need to turn the pipe at (1, 2) 90 degrees clockwise, the pipe at (2, 3) 90 degrees, the pipe at (1, 6) 90 degrees, the pipe at (1, 7) 180 degrees and the pipe at (2, 7) 180 degrees. Then the flow of water can reach (2, n + 1) from (1, 0).You have to answer q independent queries.
129	Distinct Characters Queries You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters and q queries for this string.Recall that the substring s[l; r] of the string s is the string s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r. For example, the substrings of "" are "", "", "", "", but not "" and "".There are two types of queries: 
130	Special Permutations Let's define p_i(n) as the following permutation: [i, 1, 2, \dots, i - 1, i + 1, \dots, n]. This means that the i-th permutation is  (i.e. which maps every element to itself) permutation but the element i is on the first position. Examples:You are given an array x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m (1 \le x_i \le n).Let pos(p, val) be the position of the element val in p. So, pos(p_1(4), 3) = 3, pos(p_2(4), 2) = 1, pos(p_4(4), 4) = 1.Let's define a function f(p) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m - 1} |pos(p, x_i) - pos(p, x_{i + 1})|, where |val| is the absolute value of val. This function means the sum of distances between adjacent elements of x in p.Your task is to calculate f(p_1(n)), f(p_2(n)), \dots, f(p_n(n)).
131	Yet Another Substring Reverse You are given a string s consisting only of first 20 lowercase Latin letters ('', '', ..., '').Recall that the substring s[l; r] of the string s is the string s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r. For example, the substrings of "" are "", "", "", "", but not "" and "".You can perform the following operation : choose some substring s[l; r] and  it (i.e. the string s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r becomes s_r s_{r - 1} \dots s_l).Your goal is to maximize the length of the maximum substring of s consisting of  (i.e. unique) characters.The string consists of  characters if no character in this string appears more than once. For example, strings "", "" and "" consist of distinct characters but strings "", "" do not consist of distinct characters.
132	Stones Alice is playing with some stones.Now there are three numbered heaps of stones. The first of them contains a stones, the second of them contains b stones and the third of them contains c stones.Each time she can do one of two operations:She wants to get the maximum number of stones, but she doesn't know what to do. Initially, she has 0 stones. Can you help her?
133	Alice and the List of Presents Alice got many presents these days. So she decided to pack them into boxes and send them to her friends.There are n kinds of presents. Presents of one kind are identical (i.e. there is no way to distinguish two gifts of the same kind). Presents of different kinds are different (i.e. that is, two gifts of different kinds are distinguishable). The number of presents of each kind, that Alice has is very big, so we can consider Alice has an infinite number of gifts of each kind.Also, there are m boxes. All of them are for different people, so they are pairwise distinct (consider that the names of m friends are written on the boxes). For example, putting the first kind of present into the first box but not into the second box, is different from putting the first kind of present into the second box but not into the first box.Alice wants to pack presents with the following rules:Now Alice wants to know how many different ways to pack the presents exists. Please, help her and calculate this number. Since the answer can be huge, output it by modulo 10^9+7.See examples and their notes for clarification.
134	Labs In order to do some research, n^2 labs are built on different heights of a mountain. Let's enumerate them with integers from 1 to n^2, such that the lab with the number 1 is at the lowest place, the lab with the number 2 is at the second-lowest place, \ldots, the lab with the number n^2 is at the highest place.To transport water between the labs, pipes are built between every pair of labs. A pipe can transport at most one unit of water at a time from the lab with the number u to the lab with the number v if u > v.Now the labs need to be divided into n groups, each group should contain exactly n labs. The labs from different groups can transport water to each other. The sum of units of water that can be sent from a group A to a group B is equal to the number of pairs of labs (u, v) such that the lab with the number u is from the group A, the lab with the number v is from the group B and u > v. Let's denote this value as f(A,B) (i.e. f(A,B) is the sum of units of water that can be sent from a group A to a group B).For example, if n=3 and there are 3 groups X, Y and Z: X = \{1, 5, 6\}, Y = \{2, 4, 9\} and Z = \{3, 7, 8\}. In this case, the values of f are equal to:Please, divide labs into n groups with size n, such that the value \min f(A,B) over all possible pairs of groups A and B (A \neq B) is .In other words, divide labs into n groups with size n, such that minimum number of the sum of units of water that can be transported from a group A to a group B for every pair of different groups A and B (A \neq B) as big as possible.Note, that the example above doesn't demonstrate an optimal division, but it demonstrates how to calculate the values f for some division.If there are many optimal divisions, you can find any.
135	Alice and the Doll Alice got a new doll these days. It can even walk!Alice has built a maze for the doll and wants to test it. The maze is a grid with n rows and m columns. There are k obstacles, the i-th of them is on the cell (x_i, y_i), which means the cell in the intersection of the x_i-th row and the y_i-th column.However, the doll is clumsy in some ways. It can only walk straight or turn right at most once in the same cell (including the start cell). It cannot get into a cell with an obstacle or get out of the maze.More formally, there exist 4 directions, in which the doll can look:Standing in some cell the doll can move into the cell in the direction it looks or it can turn right once. Turning right once, the doll switches it's direction by the following rules: 1 \to 2, 2 \to 3, 3 \to 4, 4 \to 1. Standing in one cell, the doll can make at most one turn right.Now Alice is controlling the doll's moves. She puts the doll in of the cell (1, 1) (the upper-left cell of the maze). Initially, the doll looks to the direction 1, so along the row from the first cell to the last. She wants to let the doll walk across all the cells without obstacles exactly once and end in any place. Can it be achieved?
136	Alice and the Unfair Game Alice is playing a game with her good friend, Marisa.There are n boxes arranged in a line, numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. Marisa will hide a doll in one of the boxes. Then Alice will have m chances to guess where the doll is. If Alice will correctly guess the number of box, where doll is now, she will win the game, otherwise, her friend will win the game.In order to win, Marisa will use some unfair tricks. After each time Alice guesses a box, she can move the doll to the neighboring box or just keep it at its place. Boxes i and i + 1 are neighboring for all 1 \leq i \leq n - 1. She can also use this trick once before the game starts.So, the game happens in this order: the game starts, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the first guess, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the second guess, Marisa makes the trick, \ldots, Alice makes m-th guess, Marisa makes the trick, the game ends.Alice has come up with a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m. In the i-th guess, she will ask if the doll is in the box a_i. She wants to know the number of scenarios (x, y) (for all 1 \leq x, y \leq n), such that Marisa can win the game if she will put the doll at the x-th box at the beginning and at the end of the game, the doll will be at the y-th box. Help her and calculate this number.
137	Alice and the Cactus Alice recently found some cactuses growing near her house! After several months, more and more cactuses appeared and soon they blocked the road. So Alice wants to clear them. is a connected undirected graph. No edge of this graph lies on more than one simple cycle. Let's call a sequence of different nodes of the graph x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k a simple cycle, if k \geq 3 and all pairs of nodes x_1 and x_2, x_2 and x_3, \ldots, x_{k-1} and x_k, x_k and x_1 are connected with edges. Edges (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), \ldots, (x_{k-1}, x_k), (x_k, x_1) lies on this simple cycle.There are so many cactuses, so it seems hard to destroy them. But Alice has magic. When she uses the magic, every node of the cactus will be removed independently with the probability \frac{1}{2}. When a node is removed, the edges connected to it are also removed.Now Alice wants to test her magic. She has picked a cactus with n nodes and m edges. Let X[S] (where S is a subset of the removed nodes) be the number of connected components in the remaining graph after removing nodes of set S. Before she uses magic, she wants to know  of random variable X, if all nodes of the graph have probability \frac{1}{2} to be removed and all n of these events are independent. By the definition the variance is equal to E[(X - E[X])^2], where E[X] is the  of X. Help her and calculate this value by modulo 10^9+7.Formally, let M = 10^9 + 7 (a prime number). It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \frac{p}{q}, where p and q are integers and q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}. Output the integer equal to p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M. In other words, find such an integer x that 0 \le x < M and x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}.
138	Balanced Rating Changes Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is a_i. These rating changes are  — their sum is equal to 0.Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared . It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.There are two conditions though: Can you help with that?
139	Balanced Tunnel Consider a tunnel on a one-way road. During a particular day, n cars numbered from 1 to n entered and exited the tunnel exactly once. All the cars passed through the tunnel at constant speeds.A traffic enforcement camera is mounted at the tunnel entrance. Another traffic enforcement camera is mounted at the tunnel exit. .Thanks to the cameras, the order in which the cars entered and exited the tunnel is known. No two cars entered or exited at the same time.Traffic regulations prohibit overtaking inside the tunnel. If car i overtakes any other car j inside the tunnel, car i must be fined. However, each car can be fined at most once.Formally, let's say that car i  car j if car i entered the tunnel later than car j and exited the tunnel earlier than car j. Then, car i must be fined if and only if it definitely overtook at least one other car.Find the number of cars that must be fined. 
140	Balanced Playlist Your favorite music streaming platform has formed a  playlist exclusively for you. The playlist consists of n tracks numbered from 1 to n. The playlist is automatic and cyclic: whenever track i finishes playing, track i+1 starts playing automatically; after track n goes track 1.For each track i, you have estimated its  a_i. The higher a_i is, the cooler track i is.Every morning, you choose a track. The playlist then starts playing from this track in its usual cyclic fashion. At any moment, you remember the maximum coolness x of already played tracks. Once you hear that a track with coolness  less than \frac{x}{2} (no rounding) starts playing, you turn off the music immediately to keep yourself in a good mood.For each track i, find out how many tracks you will listen to before turning off the music if you start your morning with track i, or determine that you will never turn the music off. Note that if you listen to the same track several times, every time must be counted.
141	Balanced Binary Search Trees Recall that a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose nodes each store a key and each have at most two distinguished subtrees, left and right. The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.The depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is 0.Let's call a binary search tree  if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.Let's call a binary search tree with integer keys  if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex v: You are given a single integer n. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with n vertices that have distinct integer keys between 1 and n, inclusive. Output this number modulo 998\,244\,353.
142	Balanced Domino Placements Consider a square grid with h rows and w columns with some dominoes on it. Each domino covers exactly two cells of the grid that share a common side. Every cell is covered by at most one domino.Let's call a placement of dominoes on the grid  if no row and no column contains a pair of cells covered by two different dominoes. In other words, every row and column may contain no covered cells, one covered cell, or two covered cells that belong to the same domino.You are given a perfectly balanced placement of dominoes on a grid. Find the number of ways to place zero or more extra dominoes on this grid to keep the placement perfectly balanced. Output this number modulo 998\,244\,353.
143	Prime Subtraction You are given two integers x and y (it is guaranteed that x > y). You may choose any  integer p and subtract it any number of times from x. Is it possible to make x equal to y?Recall that a  number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and this integer itself. The sequence of prime numbers starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.Your program should solve t independent test cases.
144	Kill 'Em All Ivan plays an old action game called Heretic. He's stuck on one of the final levels of this game, so he needs some help with killing the monsters.The main part of the level is a large corridor (so large and narrow that it can be represented as an infinite coordinate line). The corridor is divided into two parts; let's assume that the point x = 0 is where these parts meet.The right part of the corridor is filled with n monsters — for each monster, its initial coordinate x_i is given (and since all monsters are in the right part, every x_i is positive).The left part of the corridor is filled with crusher traps. If some monster enters the left part of the corridor or the origin (so, its current coordinate becomes  to 0), it gets instantly killed by a trap.The main weapon Ivan uses to kill the monsters is the Phoenix Rod. It can launch a missile that explodes upon impact, obliterating every monster caught in the explosion and throwing all other monsters away from the epicenter. Formally, suppose that Ivan launches a missile so that it explodes in the point c. Then every monster is either killed by explosion or pushed away. Let some monster's current coordinate be y, then:Ivan is going to kill the monsters as follows: choose some integer point d and launch a missile into that point, then wait until it explodes and all the monsters which are pushed to the left part of the corridor are killed by crusher traps, then, if at least one monster is still alive, choose another integer point (probably the one that was already used) and launch a missile there, and so on.What is the minimum number of missiles Ivan has to launch in order to kill all of the monsters? You may assume that every time Ivan fires the Phoenix Rod, he chooses the impact point optimally.You have to answer q independent queries.
145	Standard Free2play You are playing a game where your character should overcome different obstacles. The current problem is to come down from a cliff. The cliff has height h, and there is a moving platform on each height x from 1 to h.Each platform is either hidden inside the cliff or moved out. At first, there are n moved out platforms on heights p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. The platform on height h is moved out (and the character is initially standing there).If you character is standing on some moved out platform on height x, then he can pull a special lever, which switches the state of . In other words, the platform you are currently standing on will hide in the cliff and the platform one unit below will change it state: it will hide if it was moved out or move out if it was hidden. In the second case, you will safely land on it. .Your character is quite fragile, so it can safely fall from the height no more than 2. In other words falling from the platform x to platform x - 2 is okay, but falling from x to x - 3 (or lower) is certain death. Sometimes it's not possible to come down from the cliff, but you can always buy (for donate currency) several magic crystals. Each magic crystal can be used to change the state of any single platform (except platform on height h, which is unaffected by the crystals). After being used, the crystal disappears.What is the minimum number of magic crystal you need to buy to safely land on the 0 ground level?
146	AB-string The string t_1t_2 \dots t_k is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of length  than .A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings , , ,  are palindromes, but the strings , ,  are not.Here are some examples of good strings: You are given a string s of length n, consisting of  letters  and .You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string s.
147	Keyboard Purchase You have a password which you often type — a string s of length n. Every character of this string is one of the first m lowercase Latin letters.Since you spend a lot of time typing it, you want to buy a new keyboard.A keyboard is a permutation of the first m Latin letters. For example, if m = 3, then there are six possible keyboards: , , , ,  and .Since you type your password with one finger, you need to spend time moving your finger from one password character to the next. The time to move from character s_i to character s_{i+1} is equal to the distance between these characters on keyboard. The total time you have to spend typing the password with a keyboard is called the  of this keyboard.More formaly, the slowness of keyboard is equal to \sum\limits_{i=2}^{n} |pos_{s_{i-1}} - pos_{s_i} |, where pos_x is position of letter x in keyboard.For example, if s is  and the keyboard is , then the total time of typing this password is |pos_a - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_c| + |pos_c - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_b| + |pos_b - pos_c| = |2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 3| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5.Before buying a new keyboard you want to know the minimum possible slowness that the keyboard can have. 
148	The Maximum Subtree Assume that you have k one-dimensional segments s_1, s_2, \dots s_k (each segment is denoted by two integers — its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of k vertexes, and there is an edge between the i-th and the j-th vertexes (i \neq j) if and only if the segments s_i and s_j intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).For example, if s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18], then the resulting graph is the following:A tree of size m is good if it is possible to choose m one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.Note that you have to answer q independent queries.
149	Ivan the Fool and the Probability Theory Recently Ivan the Fool decided to become smarter and study the probability theory. He thinks that he understands the subject fairly well, and so he began to behave like he already got PhD in that area.To prove his skills, Ivan decided to demonstrate his friends a concept of random picture. A picture is a field of n rows and m columns, where each cell is either black or white. Ivan calls the picture random if for every cell it has  one adjacent cell of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.Ivan's brothers spent some time trying to explain that it's not how the randomness usually works. Trying to convince Ivan, they want to count the number of different random (according to Ivan) pictures. Two pictures are considered different if at least one cell on those two picture is colored differently. Since the number of such pictures may be quite large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
150	The World Is Just a Programming Task (Hard Version) This is a harder version of the problem. In this version, n \le 300\,000.Vasya is an experienced developer of programming competitions' problems. As all great minds at some time, Vasya faced a creative crisis. To improve the situation, Petya gifted him a string consisting of opening and closing brackets only. Petya believes, that the beauty of the bracket string is a number of its cyclical shifts, which form a correct bracket sequence.To digress from his problems, Vasya decided to select two positions of the string () and swap characters located at this positions with each other. Vasya will apply this operation exactly once. He is curious what is the maximum possible beauty he can achieve this way. Please help him.We remind that bracket sequence s is called correct if: For example, "", "" are correct, while "" and "" are not.The cyclical shift of the string s of length n by k (0 \leq k < n) is a string formed by a concatenation of the last k symbols of the string s with the first n - k symbols of string s. For example, the cyclical shift of string "" by 2 equals "".Cyclical shifts i and j are considered different, if i \ne j.
151	Queue in the Train There are n seats in the train's car and there is exactly one passenger occupying every seat. The seats are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. The trip is long, so each passenger will become hungry at some moment of time and will go to take boiled water for his noodles. The person at seat i (1 \leq i \leq n) will decide to go for boiled water at minute t_i.Tank with a boiled water is located to the left of the 1-st seat. In case too many passengers will go for boiled water simultaneously, they will form a queue, since there can be only one passenger using the tank at each particular moment of time. Each passenger uses the tank for exactly p minutes. We assume that the time it takes passengers to go from their seat to the tank is negligibly small. Nobody likes to stand in a queue. So when the passenger occupying the i-th seat wants to go for a boiled water, he will first take a look on all seats from 1 to i - 1. In case at least one of those seats is empty, he assumes that those people are standing in a queue right now, so he would be better seating for the time being. However, at the very first moment he observes that all seats with numbers smaller than i are busy, he will go to the tank.There is an unspoken rule, that in case at some moment several people can go to the tank, than only the leftmost of them (that is, seating on the seat with smallest number) will go to the tank, while all others will wait for the next moment.Your goal is to find for each passenger, when he will receive the boiled water for his noodles.
152	Catowice City In the Catowice city next weekend the cat contest will be held. However, the jury members and the contestants haven't been selected yet. There are n residents and n cats in the Catowice, and each resident has exactly one cat living in his house. The residents and cats are numbered with integers from 1 to n, where the i-th cat is living in the house of i-th resident.Each Catowice resident is in friendship with several cats, including the one living in his house. In order to conduct a contest, at least one jury member is needed and at least one cat contestant is needed. Of course, every jury member should know none of the contestants. For the contest to be successful, it's also needed that the number of jury members plus the number of contestants is equal to n.Please help Catowice residents to select the jury and the contestants for the upcoming competition, or determine that it's impossible to do.
153	Turtle Kolya has a turtle and a field of size 2 \times n. The field rows are numbered from 1 to 2 from top to bottom, while the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.Suppose in each cell of the field there is a lettuce leaf. The energy value of lettuce leaf in row i and column j is equal to a_{i,j}. The turtle is initially in the top left cell and wants to reach the bottom right cell. The turtle can only move right and down and among all possible ways it will choose a way, maximizing the total energy value of lettuce leaves (in case there are several such paths, it will choose any of them).Kolya is afraid, that if turtle will eat too much lettuce, it can be bad for its health. So he wants to reorder lettuce leaves in the field, so that the energetic cost of leaves eaten by turtle will be minimized.
154	Swiper, no swiping! In anticipation of new adventures Boots wanted to do a good deed. After discussion with the Map and Backpack, they decided to gift Dora a connected graph. After a long search, Boots chose t graph's variants, which Dora might like. However fox Swiper wants to spoil his plan.The Swiper knows, that Dora now is only able to count up to 3, so he has came up with a following idea. He wants to steal some non-empty set of vertices, so that the Dora won't notice the loss. He has decided to steal some non-empty set of vertices, so that after deletion of the stolen vertices and edges adjacent to them, every  vertex wouldn't change it's degree modulo 3. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges it is adjacent to. It would've been suspicious to steal all the vertices, so Swiper needs another plan.Boots are sure, that the crime can not be allowed. However they are afraid, that they won't be able to handle this alone. So Boots decided to ask for your help. Please determine for every graph's variant whether the Swiper can perform the theft or not.
155	Wooden Raft Suppose you are stuck on a desert island. The only way to save yourself is to craft a wooden raft and go to the sea. Fortunately, you have a hand-made saw and a forest nearby. Moreover, you've already cut several trees and prepared it to the point that now you have n logs and the i-th log has length a_i.The wooden raft you'd like to build has the following structure: 2 logs of length x and x logs of length y. Such raft would have the area equal to x \cdot y. Both  since it's the only way you can measure the lengths while being on a desert island. And both  since the raft that is one log wide is unstable.You can cut logs in pieces but you can't merge two logs in one. What is the maximum area of the raft you can craft?
156	Football There are n football teams in the world. The Main Football Organization (MFO) wants to host at most m games. MFO wants the i-th game to be played between the teams a_i and b_i in one of the k stadiums. Let s_{ij} be the numbers of games the i-th team played in the j-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in one stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team i, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum among s_{i1}, s_{i2}, \ldots, s_{ik} should not exceed 2.Each team has w_i — the amount of money MFO will earn for  game of the i-th team. If the i-th team plays l games, MFO will earn w_i \cdot l.MFO needs to find what games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money as possible, not violating the rule they set.However, this problem is too complicated for MFO. Therefore, they are asking you to help them.
157	Tile Painting Ujan has been lazy lately, but now has decided to bring his yard to good shape. First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate.The path consists of n consecutive tiles, numbered from 1 to n. Ujan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path  if for any two  tiles with numbers i and j, such that |j - i| is a divisor of n greater than 1, they have the same color. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers i and j should be the same if |i-j| > 1 and n \bmod |i-j| = 0 (where x \bmod y is the remainder when dividing x by y).Ujan wants to brighten up space. What is the maximum number of different colors that Ujan can use, so that the path is aesthetic?
158	0-1 MST Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?
159	Sum Balance Ujan has a lot of numbers in his boxes. He likes order and balance, so he decided to reorder the numbers.There are k boxes numbered from 1 to k. The i-th box contains n_i integer numbers. The integers can be negative.  Ujan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers . He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, k integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers — one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning. Note that he may also insert an integer he picked from a box back into the same box.Ujan will be happy if the sum of the integers in each box is the same. Can he achieve this and make the boxes perfectly balanced, like all things should be?
160	Number Discovery Ujan needs some rest from cleaning, so he started playing with infinite sequences. He has two integers n and k. He creates an infinite sequence s by repeating the following steps.Ujan will stop procrastinating when he writes the number n in the sequence s. Help him find the index of n in s. In other words, find the integer x such that s_{x} = n. It's possible to prove that all positive integers are included in s only once.
161	Planar Perimeter Ujan has finally cleaned up his house and now wants to decorate the interior. He decided to place a beautiful carpet that would really tie the guest room together.He is interested in carpets that are made up of polygonal patches such that each side of a patch is either a side of another (different) patch, or is an exterior side of the whole carpet. In other words, the carpet can be represented as a planar graph, where each patch corresponds to a face of the graph, each face is a simple polygon. The perimeter of the carpet is the number of the exterior sides. Ujan considers a carpet beautiful if it consists of f patches, where the i-th patch has exactly a_i sides, and the perimeter is the smallest possible. Find an example of such a carpet, so that Ujan can order it!
162	Maximum Square Ujan decided to make a new wooden roof for the house. He has n rectangular planks numbered from 1 to n. The i-th plank has size a_i \times 1 (that is, the width is 1 and the height is a_i).Now, Ujan wants to make a square roof. He will first choose some of the planks and place them side by side in some order. Then he will glue together all of these planks by their vertical sides. Finally, he will cut out a square from the resulting shape in such a way that the sides of the square are horizontal and vertical.For example, if Ujan had planks with lengths 4, 3, 1, 4 and 5, he could choose planks with lengths 4, 3 and 5. Then he can cut out a 3 \times 3 square, which is the maximum possible. Note that this is not the only way he can obtain a 3 \times 3 square.What is the maximum side length of the square Ujan can get?
163	Pens and Pencils Tomorrow is a difficult day for Polycarp: he has to attend a lectures and b practical classes at the university! Since Polycarp is a diligent student, he is going to attend all of them.While preparing for the university, Polycarp wonders whether he can take enough writing implements to write all of the lectures and draw everything he has to during all of the practical classes. Polycarp writes lectures using a pen (he can't use a pencil to write lectures!); he can write down c lectures using one pen, and after that it runs out of ink. During practical classes Polycarp draws blueprints with a pencil (he can't use a pen to draw blueprints!); one pencil is enough to draw all blueprints during d practical classes, after which it is unusable.Polycarp's pencilcase can hold no more than k writing implements, so if Polycarp wants to take x pens and y pencils, they will fit in the pencilcase if and only if x + y \le k.Now Polycarp wants to know how many pens and pencils should he take. Help him to determine it, or tell that his pencilcase doesn't have enough room for all the implements he needs tomorrow!Note that you don't have to minimize the number of writing implements (though their total number must not exceed k).
164	Rooms and Staircases Nikolay lives in a two-storied house. There are n rooms on each floor, arranged in a row and numbered from one from left to right. So each room can be represented by the number of the floor and the number of the room on this floor (room number is an integer between 1 and n). If Nikolay is currently in some room, he can move to any of the neighbouring rooms (if they exist). Rooms with numbers i and i+1 on each floor are neighbouring, for all 1 \leq i \leq n - 1. There may also be staircases that connect two rooms from different floors having the same numbers. If there is a staircase connecting the room x on the first floor and the room x on the second floor, then Nikolay can use it to move from one room to another.Nikolay wants to move through some rooms in his house. To do this, he firstly chooses any room where he starts. Then Nikolay moves between rooms according to the aforementioned rules. Nikolay never visits the same room twice (he won't enter a room where he has already been). Calculate the maximum number of rooms Nikolay can visit during his tour, if:
165	The Football Season The football season has just ended in Berland. According to the rules of Berland football, each match is played between two teams. The result of each match is either a draw, or a victory of one of the playing teams. If a team wins the match, it gets w points, and the opposing team gets 0 points. If the game results in a draw, both teams get d points.The manager of the Berland capital team wants to summarize the results of the season, but, unfortunately, all information about the results of each match is lost. The manager only knows that the team has played n games and got p points for them.You have to determine three integers x, y and z — the number of wins, draws and loses of the team. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no suitable triple (x, y, z), report about it.
166	Paint the Tree You are given a tree consisting of n vertices. A tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph.You have to paint each vertex into one of three colors. For each vertex, you know the cost of painting it in every color.You have to paint the vertices so that any path consisting of exactly three distinct vertices does not contain any vertices with equal colors. In other words, let's consider all triples (x, y, z) such that x \neq y, y \neq z, x \neq z, x is connected by an edge with y, and y is connected by an edge with z. The colours of x, y and z should be pairwise distinct. Let's call a painting which meets this condition .You have to calculate the minimum cost of a  painting and find one of the optimal paintings. If there is no  painting, report about it.
167	Minimizing Difference You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n consisting of n integers.You may perform the following operation on this sequence: choose any element and either increase or decrease it by one.Calculate the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation  k times.
168	Chips There are n chips arranged in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Initially each chip has black or white color. Then k iterations occur. During each iteration the chips change their colors according to the following rules. For each chip i, three chips are considered: chip i itself and two its neighbours. If the number of white chips among these three is greater than the number of black chips among these three chips, then the chip i becomes white. Otherwise, the chip i becomes black. Note that for each i from 2 to (n - 1) two neighbouring chips have numbers (i - 1) and (i + 1). The neighbours for the chip i = 1 are n and 2. The neighbours of i = n are (n - 1) and 1.The following picture describes one iteration with n = 6. The chips 1, 3 and 4 are initially black, and the chips 2, 5 and 6 are white. After the iteration 2, 3 and 4 become black, and 1, 5 and 6 become white.Your task is to determine the color of each chip after k iterations.
169	Good ol' Numbers Coloring Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: {0, 1, 2, \dots}. Given two integers a and b (1 \le a, b \le 10^4). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint 0, then we paint 1, then 2 and so on.Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number i according to the following rules: In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.For example, if a=3, b=5, then the colors of the numbers (in the order from 0) are: white (0), black (1), black (2), white (3), black (4), white (5), white (6), black (7), white (8), white (9), ...Note that: Your task is to determine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored  is infinite.If there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black, simply print a line containing "" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "" (without the quotes).
170	Restricted RPS Let n be a positive integer. Let a, b, c be nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = n.Alice and Bob are gonna play rock-paper-scissors n times. Alice knows the sequences of hands that Bob will play. However, Alice has to play rock a times, paper b times, and scissors c times.Alice wins if she beats Bob in at least \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil (\frac{n}{2} rounded up to the nearest integer) hands, otherwise Alice loses.Note that in rock-paper-scissors:The task is, given the sequence of hands that Bob will play, and the numbers a, b, c, determine whether or not Alice can win. And if so, find any possible sequence of hands that Alice can use to win.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
171	Constanze's Machine Constanze is the smartest girl in her village but she has bad eyesight.One day, she was able to invent an incredible machine! When you pronounce letters, the machine will inscribe them onto a piece of paper. For example, if you pronounce 'c', 'o', 'd', and 'e' in that order, then the machine will inscribe "" onto the paper. Thanks to this machine, she can finally write messages without using her glasses.However, her dumb friend Akko decided to play a prank on her. Akko tinkered with the machine so that if you pronounce 'w', it will inscribe "" instead of "", and if you pronounce 'm', it will inscribe "" instead of ""! Since Constanze had bad eyesight, she was not able to realize what Akko did.The rest of the letters behave the same as before: if you pronounce any letter besides 'w' and 'm', the machine will just inscribe it onto a piece of paper.The next day, I received a letter in my mailbox. I can't understand it so I think it's either just some gibberish from Akko, or Constanze made it using her machine. But since I know what Akko did, I can just list down all possible strings that Constanze's machine would have turned into the message I got and see if anything makes sense.But I need to know how much paper I will need, and that's why I'm asking you for help. Tell me the number of strings that Constanze's machine would've turned into the message I got.But since this number can be quite large, tell me instead its remainder when divided by 10^9+7.If there are no strings that Constanze's machine would've turned into the message I got, then print 0.
172	Shichikuji and Power Grid Shichikuji is the new resident deity of the South Black Snail Temple. Her first job is as follows:There are n new cities located in Prefecture X. Cities are numbered from 1 to n. City i is located x_i km North of the shrine and y_i km East of the shrine. It is possible that (x_i, y_i) = (x_j, y_j) even when i \ne j.Shichikuji must provide electricity to each city either by building a power station in that city, or by making a connection between that city and another one that already has electricity. So the City has electricity if it has a power station in it or it is connected to a City which has electricity by a direct connection or via a chain of connections.Shichikuji wants to do this job spending as little money as possible, since according to her, there isn't really anything else in the world other than money. However, she died when she was only in fifth grade so she is not smart enough for this. And thus, the new resident deity asks for your help.And so, you have to provide Shichikuji with the following information: minimum amount of yen needed to provide electricity to all cities, the cities in which power stations will be built, and the connections to be made.If there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them.
173	Hyakugoku and Ladders Hyakugoku has just retired from being the resident deity of the South Black Snail Temple in order to pursue her dream of becoming a cartoonist. She spent six months in that temple just playing "Cat's Cradle" so now she wants to try a different game — "Snakes and Ladders". Unfortunately, she already killed all the snakes, so there are only ladders left now. The game is played on a 10 \times 10 board as follows:Please note that: Hyakugoku wants to finish the game as soon as possible. Thus, on each turn she chooses whether to climb the ladder or not optimally. Help her to determine the minimum expected number of turns the game will take.
174	Daniel and Spring Cleaning While doing some spring cleaning, Daniel found an old calculator that he loves so much. However, it seems like it is broken. When he tries to compute 1 + 3 using the calculator, he gets 2 instead of 4. But when he tries computing 1 + 4, he gets the correct answer, 5. Puzzled by this mystery, he opened up his calculator and found the answer to the riddle: the full adders became half adders! So, when he tries to compute the sum a + b using the calculator, he instead gets the xorsum a \oplus b (read the definition by the link: ).As he saw earlier, the calculator sometimes gives the correct answer. And so, he wonders, given integers l and r, how many pairs of integers (a, b) satisfy the following conditions: a + b = a \oplus b l \leq a \leq r l \leq b \leq rHowever, Daniel the Barman is going to the bar and will return in two hours. He tells you to solve the problem before he returns, or else you will have to enjoy being blocked.
175	Integer Points DLS and JLS are bored with a Math lesson. In order to entertain themselves, DLS took a sheet of paper and drew n distinct lines, given by equations y = x + p_i for some distinct p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.Then JLS drew on the same paper sheet m distinct lines given by equations y = -x + q_i for some distinct q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_m.DLS and JLS are interested in counting how many line pairs have  intersection points, i.e. points with both coordinates that are integers. Unfortunately, the lesson will end up soon, so DLS and JLS are asking for your help.
176	Grow The Tree Gardener Alexey teaches competitive programming to high school students. To congratulate Alexey on the Teacher's Day, the students have gifted him a collection of wooden sticks, where every stick has an integer length. Now Alexey wants to grow a tree from them.The tree looks like a polyline on the plane, consisting of all sticks. The polyline starts at the point (0, 0). While constructing the polyline, Alexey will attach sticks to it one by one in arbitrary order. Each stick must be either vertical or horizontal (that is, parallel to OX or OY axis). It is not allowed for two consecutive sticks to be aligned simultaneously horizontally or simultaneously vertically. See the images below for clarification.Alexey wants to make a polyline in such a way that its end is as far as possible from (0, 0). Please help him to grow the tree this way.Note that the polyline defining the form of the tree may have self-intersections and self-touches, but it can be proved that the optimal answer does not contain any self-intersections or self-touches.
177	Yet Another Dividing into Teams You are a coach of a group consisting of n students. The i-th student has programming skill a_i. . You want to divide them into teams in such a way that:You have to answer q independent queries.
178	By Elevator or Stairs? You are planning to buy an apartment in a n-floor building. The floors are numbered from 1 to n from the bottom to the top. At first for each floor you want to know the minimum total time to reach it from the first (the bottom) floor.Let:In one , you can go from the floor you are staying at x to any floor y (x \ne y) in two different ways:You can perform as many  as you want (possibly zero).So your task is for each i to determine the minimum total time it takes to reach the i-th floor from the 1-st (bottom) floor.
179	Maximum Weight Subset You are given a tree, which consists of n vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. All vertices have weights, the weight of the vertex v is a_v.Recall that the distance between two vertices in the tree is the number of edges on a simple path between them.Your task is to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight (the weight of the subset is the sum of weights of all vertices in it) such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance k or less between them in this subset.
180	Berstagram Polycarp recently signed up to a new social network Berstagram. He immediately published n posts there. He assigned numbers from 1 to n to all posts and published them one by one. So, just after publishing Polycarp's news feed contained posts from 1 to n — the highest post had number 1, the next one had number 2, ..., the lowest post had number n.After that he wrote down all likes from his friends. Likes were coming consecutively from the 1-st one till the m-th one. You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m (1 \le a_j \le n), where a_j is the post that received the j-th like.News feed in Berstagram works in the following manner. Let's assume the j-th like was given to post a_j. If this post is not the highest (first) one then it changes its position with the one above. If a_j is the highest post nothing changes. For example, if n=3, m=5 and a=[3,2,1,3,3], then Polycarp's news feed had the following states:Polycarp wants to know the highest (minimum) and the lowest (maximum) positions for each post. Polycarp considers all moments of time, including the moment "before all likes".
181	The Feast and the Bus Employees of JebTrains are on their way to celebrate the 256-th day of the year! There are n employees and k teams in JebTrains. Each employee is a member of some (exactly one) team. All teams are numbered from 1 to k. You are given an array of numbers t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n where t_i is the i-th employee's team number.JebTrains is going to rent a single bus to get employees to the feast. The bus will take one or more rides. A bus can pick up an entire team or two entire teams. If three or more teams take a ride together they may start a new project which is considered unacceptable. It's prohibited to split a team, so all members of a team should take the same ride.It is possible to rent a bus of any capacity s. Such a bus can take up to s people on a single ride. The total cost of the rent is equal to s \cdot r burles where r is the number of rides. Note that it's impossible to rent two or more buses.Help JebTrains to calculate the minimum cost of the rent, required to get all employees to the feast, fulfilling all the conditions above.
182	Trip to Saint Petersburg You are planning your trip to Saint Petersburg. After doing some calculations, you estimated that you will have to spend k rubles each day you stay in Saint Petersburg — you have to rent a flat, to eat at some local cafe, et cetera. So, if the day of your arrival is L, and the day of your departure is R, you will have to spend k(R - L + 1) rubles in Saint Petersburg.You don't want to spend a lot of money on your trip, so you decided to work in Saint Petersburg during your trip. There are n available projects numbered from 1 to n, the i-th of them lasts from the day l_i to the day r_i inclusive. If you choose to participate in the i-th project, then you have to stay and work in Saint Petersburg for the entire time this project lasts, but you get paid p_i rubles for completing it.Now you want to come up with an optimal trip plan: you have to choose the day of arrival L, the day of departure R and the set of projects S to participate in so that all the following conditions are met:You may assume that no matter how many projects you choose, you will still have time and ability to participate in all of them, even if they overlap.
183	Conference Problem A large-scale conference on unnatural sciences is going to be held soon in Berland! In total, n scientists from all around the world have applied. All of them have indicated a time segment when they will attend the conference: two integers l_i, r_i — day of arrival and day of departure.Also, some of the scientists have indicated their country, while some preferred not to. So, each scientist also has a value c_i, where:Everyone knows that it is interesting and useful to chat with representatives of other countries! A participant of the conference will be upset if she will not meet people from other countries during the stay. It is possible to meet people during all time of stay, including the day of arrival and the day of departure.Conference organizers need to be ready for the worst! They are interested in the largest number x, that it is possible that among all people attending the conference exactly x will be upset.Help the organizers to find the maximum number of upset scientists.
184	The Coronation The coronation of King Berl XXII is soon! The whole royal family, including n daughters of Berl XXII, will be present.The King has ordered his jeweler to assemble n beautiful necklaces, so each of the princesses could wear exactly one necklace during the ceremony — and now these necklaces are finished. Each necklace consists of m gems attached to a gold chain. There are two types of gems used in the necklaces — emeralds and sapphires. So, each necklace can be represented by a sequence of m gems (listed from left to right), and each gem is either an emerald or a sapphire. Formally, the i-th necklace can be represented by a binary string s_i of length m; if the j-th character of s_i is , then the j-th gem in the i-th necklace is an emerald; otherwise, this gem is a sapphire.Now, looking at the necklaces, the King is afraid that some of his daughters may envy the other daughters' necklaces. He wants all necklaces to look . Two necklaces are considered  if there are at least k positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems.For example, if there is a necklace represented by a sequence  and a necklace represented by a sequence , then there are 3 positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems (both first gems are emeralds, both second gems are sapphires, and both fifth gems are emeralds). So if k = 3, these necklaces are , and if k = 4, they are not .The King thinks that if two of his daughters notice that their necklaces are not , then they may have a conflict — and, obviously, he doesn't want any conflicts during the coronation! So Berl XXII wants to tell some of his daughters to wear their necklaces backward. If a necklace is worn backward, then the sequence of gems in this necklace is reversed. For example, if a necklace is represented by a sequence , then, if worn backward, it would be represented by a sequence . The King wants to find the minimum number of necklaces to be worn backward during the coronation so that there are no conflicts.Berl XXII is too busy with preparation for the coronation, so he ordered you to resolve this issue for him. Help him — and he will give you a truly royal reward! 
185	Data Center You are developing a project to build a new data center. The data center will be a rectangle with an area of exactly n square meters. Each side of the data center must be an integer.Your goal is to minimize the impact of the external environment on the data center. For this reason, you want to minimize the length of the perimeter of the data center (that is, the sum of the lengths of its four sides).What is the minimum perimeter of a rectangular data center with an area of exactly n square meters, if the lengths of all its sides must be integers?
186	Broken Keyboard Recently Polycarp noticed that some of the buttons of his keyboard are malfunctioning. For simplicity, we assume that Polycarp's keyboard contains 26 buttons (one for each letter of the Latin alphabet). Each button is either working fine or malfunctioning. To check which buttons need replacement, Polycarp pressed some buttons in sequence, and a string s appeared on the screen. When Polycarp presses a button with character c, one of the following events happened:For example, suppose the buttons corresponding to characters  and  are working correctly, and the button corresponding to  is malfunctioning. If Polycarp presses the buttons in the order , , , , , , , then the string he is typing changes as follows:  \rightarrow  \rightarrow  \rightarrow  \rightarrow  \rightarrow  \rightarrow .You are given a string s which appeared on the screen after Polycarp pressed some buttons. Help Polycarp to determine which buttons are working correctly for sure (that is, this string could not appear on the screen if any of these buttons was malfunctioning).You may assume that the buttons don't start malfunctioning when Polycarp types the string: each button either works correctly throughout the whole process, or malfunctions throughout the whole process.
187	Binary Palindromes A palindrome is a string t which reads the same backward as forward (formally, t[i] = t[|t| + 1 - i] for all i \in [1, |t|]). Here |t| denotes the length of a string t. For example, the strings ,  and  are palindromes.You have n binary strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n (each s_i consists of zeroes and/or ones). You can swap any pair of characters any number of times (possibly, zero). Characters can be either from the same string or from different strings — there are no restrictions.Formally, in one move you:What is the maximum number of strings you can make palindromic simultaneously?
188	Minimize The Integer You are given a huge integer a consisting of n digits (n is between 1 and 3 \cdot 10^5, inclusive). It may contain leading zeros.You can swap two digits on adjacent (neighboring) positions if the swapping digits are of different parity (that is, they have different remainders when divided by 2). For example, if a = 032867235 you can get the following integers in a single operation: Note, that you can't swap digits on positions 2 and 4 because the positions are not adjacent. Also, you can't swap digits on positions 3 and 4 because the digits have the same parity.You can perform any number (possibly, zero) of such operations.Find the minimum integer you can obtain.
189	Salary Changing You are the head of a large enterprise. n people work at you, and n is odd (i. e. n is not divisible by 2).You have to distribute salaries to your employees. Initially, you have s dollars for it, and the i-th employee should get a salary from l_i to r_i dollars. You have to distribute salaries in such a way that the median salary is .To find the median of a sequence of odd length, you have to sort it and take the element in the middle position after sorting. For example:It is guaranteed that you have enough money to pay the minimum salary, i.e l_1 + l_2 + \dots + l_n \le s.You have to answer t test cases.
190	Red-White Fence Polycarp wants to build a fence near his house. He has n white boards and k red boards he can use to build it. Each board is characterised by its length, which is an integer.A good fence should consist of  red board and several (possibly zero) white boards. The red board should be the longest one in the fence (every white board used in the fence should be strictly shorter), and the sequence of lengths of boards should be ascending before the red board and descending after it. Formally, if m boards are used, and their lengths are l_1, l_2, ..., l_m in the order they are placed in the fence, from left to right (let's call this array [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_m] ), the following conditions should hold:When Polycarp will build his fence, he will place all boards from left to right on the same height of 0, without any gaps, so these boards compose a polygon:Polycarp is interested in fences of some special perimeters. He has q  integers he really likes (these integers are Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_q), and for every such integer Q_i, he wants to calculate the number of different fences with perimeter Q_i he can build (two fences are considered different if their  are different). Can you help him calculate these values?
191	Cleaning Robots The new ICPC town has N junctions (numbered from 1 to N) which are connected by N-1 roads. It is possible from one junction to go to any other junctions by going through one or more roads. To make sure all the junctions are well-maintained, the government environment agency is planning to deploy their newest advanced cleaning robots. In addition to its cleaning ability, each robot is also equipped with a movement ability such that it can move from one junction to any other junctions connected by roads. However, as you might have guessed, such robots are not cheap. Therefore, the agency is considering the following deployment plan.Let T_k be the set of junctions which should be cleaned by the k^{th} robot (also known as, the robot's task), and |T_k| \ge 1 be the number of junctions in T_k. The junctions in T_k form a , i.e. there exists a sequence of v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{|T_k|} where v_i \in T_k and v_i \neq v_j for all i \neq j such that each adjacent junction in this sequence is connected by a road. The union of T for all robots is equal to the set of all junctions in ICPC town. On the other hand, no two robots share a common junction, i.e. T_i \cap T_j = \emptyset if i \neq j.To avoid complaints from citizens for an inefficient operation, the deployment plan should be ; in other words, there should be no two robots, i and j, such that T_i \cup T_j forms a (longer) path. Note that the agency does not care whether the number of robots being used is minimized as long as all the tasks are irreducible.Your task in this problem is to count the number of feasible deployment plan given the town's layout. A plan is feasible if and only if it satisfies all the above-mentioned requirements.For example, let N = 6 and the roads are \{(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(4,6)\}. There are 5 feasible deployment plans as shown in the following figure. 
192	Even Path Pathfinding is a task of finding a route between two points. It often appears in many problems. For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze.The maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers A of N \times N. The value of each cell is generated from a given array R and C of N integers each. Specifically, the value on the i^{th} row and j^{th} column, cell (i,j), is equal to R_i + C_j. Note that all indexes in this problem are from 1 to N.A path in this maze is defined as a sequence of cells (r_1,c_1), (r_2,c_2), \dots, (r_k,c_k) such that |r_i - r_{i+1}| + |c_i - c_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 \le i < k. In other words, each adjacent cell differs only by 1 row or only by 1 column. An  in this maze is defined as a path in which all the cells in the path contain only even numbers.Given a tuple \langle r_a,c_a,r_b,c_b \rangle as a query, your task is to determine whether there exists an even path from cell (r_a,c_a) to cell (r_b,c_b). To simplify the problem, it is guaranteed that both cell (r_a,c_a) and cell (r_b,c_b) contain even numbers.For example, let N = 5, R = \{6, 2, 7, 8, 3\}, and C = \{3, 4, 8, 5, 1\}. The following figure depicts the matrix A of 5 \times 5 which is generated from the given array R and C.Let us consider several queries: 
193	Find String in a Grid You have a grid G containing R rows (numbered from 1 to R, top to bottom) and C columns (numbered from 1 to C, left to right) of uppercase characters. The character in the r^{th} row and the c^{th} column is denoted by G_{r, c}. You also have Q strings containing uppercase characters. For each of the string, you want to find the number of occurrences of the string in the grid.An occurrence of string S in the grid is counted if S can be constructed by starting at one of the cells in the grid, going right 0 or more times, and then going down 0 or more times. Two occurrences are different if the set of cells used to construct the string is different. Formally, for each string S, you would like to count the number of tuples \langle r, c, \Delta r, \Delta c \rangle such that: 
194	Songwriter Andi is a mathematician, a computer scientist, and a songwriter. After spending so much time writing songs, he finally writes a catchy melody that he thought as his best creation. However, the singer who will sing the song/melody has a unique vocal range, thus, an adjustment may be needed.A melody is defined as a sequence of N notes which are represented by integers. Let A be the original melody written by Andi. Andi needs to adjust A into a new melody B such that for every i where 1 \le i < N: Help Andi to determine whether such B exists, and find the lexicographically smallest B if it exists. A melody X is lexicographically smaller than melody Y if and only if there exists j (1 \le j \le N) such that X_i = Y_i for all i < j and X_{j} < Y_{j}.For example, consider a melody A = \{1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,12\} as shown in the following figure. The diagonal arrow up in the figure implies that A_i < A_{i+1}, the straight right arrow implies that A_i = A_{i+1}, and the diagonal arrow down implies that A_i > A_{i+1}.Supposed we want to make a new melody with L = 1, R = 8, and K = 6. The new melody B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8\} as shown in the figure satisfies all the requirements, and it is the lexicographically smallest possible.
195	Regular Forestation A forestation is an act of planting a bunch of trees to grow a forest, usually to replace a forest that had been cut down. Strangely enough, graph theorists have another idea on how to make a forest, i.e. by cutting down a tree!A tree is a graph of N nodes connected by N - 1 edges. Let u be a node in a tree U which degree is at least 2 (i.e. directly connected to at least 2 other nodes in U). If we remove u from U, then we will get two or more disconnected (smaller) trees, or also known as forest by graph theorists. In this problem, we are going to investigate a special forestation of a tree done by graph theorists.Let V(S) be the set of nodes in a tree S and V(T) be the set of nodes in a tree T. Tree S and tree T are  if there exists a bijection f : V(S) \rightarrow V(T) such that for all pairs of nodes (s_i, s_j) in V(S), s_i and s_j is connected by an edge in S if and only if node f(s_i) and f(s_j) is connected by an edge in T. Note that f(s) = t implies node s in S corresponds to node t in T.We call a node u in a tree U as a good cutting point if and only if the removal of u from U causes two or more disconnected trees, and all those disconnected trees are pairwise identical.Given a tree U, your task is to determine whether there exists a good cutting point in U. If there is such a node, then you should output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point.For example, consider the following tree of 13 nodes.There is exactly one good cutting point in this tree, i.e. node 4. Observe that by removing node 4, we will get three identical trees (in this case, line graphs), i.e. \{5, 1, 7, 13\}, \{8, 2, 11, 6\}, and \{3, 12, 9, 10\}, which are denoted by A, B, and C respectively in the figure. 
196	Single Push You're given two arrays a[1 \dots n] and b[1 \dots n], both of the same length n.In order to perform a , you have to choose three integers l, r, k satisfying 1 \le l \le r \le n and k > 0. Then, you will add k to elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r.For example, if a = [3, 7, 1, 4, 1, 2] and you choose (l = 3, r = 5, k = 2), the array a will become [3, 7, \underline{3, 6, 3}, 2].You can do this operation . Can you make array a equal to array b?(We consider that a = b if and only if, for every 1 \le i \le n, a_i = b_i)
197	Silly Mistake The Central Company has an office with a sophisticated security system. There are 10^6 employees, numbered from 1 to 10^6.The security system logs entrances and departures. The entrance of the i-th employee is denoted by the integer i, while the departure of the i-th employee is denoted by the integer -i.The company has some strict rules about access to its office:Any array of events satisfying these conditions is called a .Some examples of valid or invalid days:There are n events a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, in the order they occurred. This array corresponds to one or more consecutive days. The system administrator erased the dates of events by mistake, but he didn't change the order of the events.You must partition (to cut) the array a of events into , which must represent non-empty valid days (or say that it's impossible). Each array element should belong to exactly one contiguous subarray of a partition. Each contiguous subarray of a partition should be a .For example, if n=8 and a=[1, -1, 1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3] then he can partition it into two contiguous subarrays which are valid days: a = [1, -1~ \boldsymbol{|}~ 1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3].Help the administrator to partition the given array a in the required way or report that it is impossible to do. Find any required partition, you should not minimize or maximize the number of parts.
198	Sweets Eating Tsumugi brought n delicious sweets to the Light Music Club. They are numbered from 1 to n, where the i-th sweet has a sugar concentration described by an integer a_i.Yui loves sweets, but she can eat at most m sweets each day for health reasons.Days are 1-indexed (numbered 1, 2, 3, \ldots). Eating the sweet i at the d-th day will cause a sugar penalty of (d \cdot a_i), as sweets become more sugary with time. A sweet can be eaten at most once.The total sugar penalty will be the  of the individual penalties of each sweet eaten.Suppose that Yui chooses exactly k sweets, and eats them in any order she wants. What is the  total sugar penalty she can get?Since Yui is an undecided girl, she wants you to answer this question for every value of k between 1 and n.
199	Harmonious Graph You're given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges. Nodes are numbered from 1 to n.The graph is considered  if and only if the following property holds:In other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node l we can reach a node r through edges (l < r), then we should able to reach nodes (l+1), (l+2), \ldots, (r-1) too.What is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious? 
200	Antenna Coverage The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).To modernize the street, we need to make all  positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by  one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?
201	Cheap Robot You're given a simple, undirected, connected, weighted graph with n nodes and m edges.Nodes are numbered from 1 to n. There are exactly k  (recharge points), which are nodes 1, 2, \ldots, k.We consider a robot moving into this graph, with a battery of capacity c, not fixed by the constructor yet. At any time, the battery contains an integer amount x of energy between 0 and c inclusive.Traversing an edge of weight w_i is possible only if x \ge w_i, and costs w_i energy points (x := x - w_i).Moreover, when the robot reaches a central, its battery is entirely recharged (x := c).You're given q  missions, the i-th mission requires to move the robot from  a_i to  b_i.For each mission, you should tell the minimum capacity required to acheive it.
202	Feeding Chicken Long is a huge fan of CFC (Codeforces Fried Chicken). But the price of CFC is increasing, so he decides to breed the chicken on his own farm.His farm is presented by a rectangle grid with r rows and c columns. Some of these cells contain rice, others are empty. k chickens are living on his farm. Long wants to give his chicken playgrounds by assigning these farm cells to his chickens. He would like to satisfy the following requirements:Long also wants to prevent his chickens from fighting for food. Hence he wants the difference between the maximum and the minimum number of cells with rice assigned to a chicken to be as small as possible. Please help him.
203	Point Ordering Khanh has n points on the Cartesian plane, denoted by a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. All points' coordinates are integers between -10^9 and 10^9, inclusive. No three points are collinear. He says that these points are vertices of a convex polygon; in other words, there exists a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n such that the polygon a_{p_1} a_{p_2} \ldots a_{p_n} is convex and vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order.Khanh gives you the number n, but hides the coordinates of his points. Your task is to guess the above permutation by asking multiple queries. In each query, you give Khanh 4 integers t, i, j, k; where either t = 1 or t = 2; and i, j, k are three  indices from 1 to n, inclusive. In response, Khanh tells you:Recall that the  of vector \overrightarrow{a} = (x_a, y_a) and vector \overrightarrow{b} = (x_b, y_b) is the  x_a \cdot y_b - x_b \cdot y_a. The  of a number is 1 it it is positive, and -1 otherwise. It can be proven that the cross product obtained in the above queries can not be 0.You can ask at most 3 \cdot n queries.Please note that Khanh fixes the coordinates of his points and does not change it while answering your queries. You do not need to guess the coordinates. In your permutation a_{p_1}a_{p_2}\ldots a_{p_n}, p_1 should be equal to 1 and the indices of vertices should be .
204	Tree Queries Hanh is a famous biologist. He loves growing trees and doing experiments on his own garden.One day, he got a tree consisting of n vertices. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. A tree with n vertices is an undirected connected graph with n-1 edges. Initially, Hanh sets the value of every vertex to 0.Now, Hanh performs q operations, each is either of the following types: Since Hanh is good at biology but not math, he needs your help on these operations.
205	Send Tree to Charlie Christmas was knocking on the door, and our protagonist, Bob, was preparing a spectacular present for his long-time second best friend Charlie. As chocolate boxes are lame, he decided to decorate a tree instead. Bob's tree can be represented as an undirected connected graph with n nodes (numbered 1 to n) and n-1 edges. Initially, Bob placed a decoration with label i on node i, for each 1 \le i \le n. However, as such a simple arrangement is lame, he decided to shuffle the decorations a bit. Formally, Bob did the following steps:After finishing, Bob seemed satisfied with the arrangement, so he went to sleep.The next morning, Bob wakes up only to find out that his beautiful arrangement has been ruined! Last night, Bob's younger brother Bobo dropped some of the decorations on the floor while he was playing with the tree. Fortunately, no decorations were lost, so Bob can repair the tree in no time. However, he completely forgets how the tree looked like yesterday. Therefore, given the labels of the decorations still on the tree, Bob wants to know the number of possible configurations of the tree. As the result can be quite large, Bob will be happy if you can output the result modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7). Note that, it is possible that there exists no possible configurations.
206	Changing Volume Bob watches TV every day. He always sets the volume of his TV to b. However, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to a. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume.There are six buttons (-5, -2, -1, +1, +2, +5) on the control, which in one press can either increase or decrease the current volume by 1, 2, or 5. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In other words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than 0.As Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to b using as few button presses as possible. However, he forgets how to do such simple calculations, so he asks you for help. Write a program that given a and b, finds the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from a to b.
207	Fridge Lockers Hanh lives in a shared apartment. There are n people (including Hanh) living there, each has a private fridge. n fridges are secured by several steel chains. Each steel chain connects two  fridges and is protected by a digital lock. The owner of a fridge knows passcodes of all chains connected to it. A fridge can be open only if all chains connected to it are unlocked. For example, if a fridge has no chains connected to it at all, then any of n people can open it.The weights of these fridges are a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. To make a steel chain connecting fridges u and v, you have to pay a_u + a_v dollars. Note that the landlord allows you to create . Hanh's apartment landlord asks you to create exactly m steel chains so that all fridges are private. A fridge is private if and only if, among n people living in the apartment, only the owner can open it (i.e. no other person acting alone can do it). In other words, the fridge i is not private if there exists the person j (i \ne j) that the person j can open the fridge i.For example, in the picture all the fridges are private. On the other hand, if there are n=2 fridges and only one chain (which connects them) then both fridges are not private (both fridges can be open not only by its owner but also by another person).Of course, the landlord wants to minimize the total cost of all steel chains to fulfill his request. Determine whether there exists any way to make exactly m chains, and if yes, output any solution that minimizes the total cost. 
208	League of Leesins Bob is an avid fan of the video game "", and today he celebrates as the League of Leesins World Championship comes to an end! The tournament consisted of n (n \ge 5) teams around the world. Before the tournament starts, Bob has made a prediction of the rankings of each team, from 1-st to n-th. After the final, he compared the prediction with the actual result and found out that the i-th team according to his prediction ended up at the p_i-th position (1 \le p_i \le n, all p_i are unique). In other words, p is a permutation of 1, 2, \dots, n.As Bob's favorite League player is the famous "", he decided to write down every 3 consecutive elements of the permutation p. Formally, Bob created an array q of n-2 triples, where q_i = (p_i, p_{i+1}, p_{i+2}) for each 1 \le i \le n-2. Bob was very proud of his array, so he showed it to his friend Alice.After learning of Bob's array, Alice declared that she could retrieve the permutation p even if Bob rearranges the elements of q and the elements within each triple. Of course, Bob did not believe in such magic, so he did just the same as above to see Alice's respond.For example, if n = 5 and p = [1, 4, 2, 3, 5], then the original array q will be [(1, 4, 2), (4, 2, 3), (2, 3, 5)]. Bob can then rearrange the numbers within each triple and the positions of the triples to get [(4, 3, 2), (2, 3, 5), (4, 1, 2)]. Note that [(1, 4, 2), (4, 2, 2), (3, 3, 5)] is not a valid rearrangement of q, as Bob is not allowed to swap numbers belong to different triples.As Alice's friend, you know for sure that Alice was just trying to show off, so you decided to save her some face by giving her  p that is consistent with the array q she was given. 
209	Payment Without Change You have a coins of value n and b coins of value 1. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such x and y that if you take x (0 \le x \le a) coins of value n and y (0 \le y \le b) coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S.You have to answer q independent test cases.
210	Minimize the Permutation You are given a permutation of length n. Recall that the permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1, 3, 4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).You can perform at most n-1 operations with the given permutation (it is possible that you don't perform any operations at all). The i-th operation allows you to swap elements of the given permutation on positions i and i+1. . The operations can be performed in arbitrary order.Your task is to find the lexicographically minimum possible permutation obtained by performing some of the given operations in some order.You can see the definition of the lexicographical order in the notes section.You have to answer q independent test cases.For example, let's consider the permutation [5, 4, 1, 3, 2]. The minimum possible permutation we can obtain is [1, 5, 2, 4, 3] and we can do it in the following way:Another example is [1, 2, 4, 3]. The minimum possible permutation we can obtain is [1, 2, 3, 4] by performing the third operation (swap the third and the fourth elements).
211	Platforms Jumping There is a river of width n. The left bank of the river is cell 0 and the right bank is cell n + 1 (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of n + 2 cells numbered from 0 to n + 1). There are also m wooden platforms on a river, the i-th platform has length c_i (so the i-th platform takes c_i consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed n.You are standing at 0 and want to reach n+1 somehow. If you are standing at the position x, you can jump to any position in the range [x + 1; x + d].  you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if d=1, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). .You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms. (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).For example, if n=7, m=3, d=2 and c = [1, 2, 1], then one of the ways to reach 8 from 0 is follow:
212	Binary String Minimizing You are given a binary string of length n (i. e. a string consisting of n characters '' and '').In one move you can swap two adjacent characters of the string. What is the lexicographically minimum possible string you can obtain from the given one if you can perform  than k moves? It is possible that you do not perform any moves at all.Note that you can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices i and i+1 arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times. Each such swap is considered a separate move.You have to answer q independent test cases.
213	Yet Another Division Into Teams There are n students at your university. The programming skill of the i-th student is a_i. As a coach, you want to divide them into teams to prepare them for the upcoming ICPC finals. Just imagine how good this university is if it has 2 \cdot 10^5 students ready for the finals!Each team should consist of . Each student should belong to . The  of a team is the difference between the  programming skill of some student that belongs to this team and the  programming skill of some student that belongs to this team (in other words, if the team consists of k students with programming skills a[i_1], a[i_2], \dots, a[i_k], then the  of this team is \max\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j] - \min\limits_{j=1}^{k} a[i_j]).The total  is the sum of  of all teams formed.Your task is to minimize the total  of the division of students and find the optimal way to divide the students.
214	Equalizing Two Strings You are given two strings s and t both of length n and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one move, you can choose any length len from 1 to n and perform the following operation: Note that during one move you reverse  substring of the string s and  substring of the string t.Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in s and in t , the only restriction is that you reverse the substrings of equal length. For example, if len=3 and n=5, you can reverse s[1 \dots 3] and t[3 \dots 5], s[2 \dots 4] and t[2 \dots 4], but not s[1 \dots 3] and t[1 \dots 2].Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings s and t equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves.You have to answer q independent test cases.
215	Two Rival Students You are the gym teacher in the school.There are n students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position a, the second in position b. Positions are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.Since they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions p and s respectively, then distance between them is |p - s|. You can do the following operation at most x times: choose two  students and swap them.Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most x swaps.
216	Magic Stick Recently Petya walked in the forest and found a magic stick.Since Petya really likes numbers, the first thing he learned was spells for changing numbers. So far, he knows only two spells that can be applied to a  integer: Note that if the number is even and greater than one, then Petya can choose which spell to apply.Petya now has only one number x. He wants to know if his favorite number y can be obtained from x using the spells he knows. The spells can be used any number of times in any order. It is not required to use spells, Petya can leave x as it is.
217	Dominated Subarray Let's call an array t  by value v in the next situation.At first, array t should have at least 2 elements. Now, let's calculate number of occurrences of each number num in t and define it as occ(num). Then t is dominated (by v) if (and only if) occ(v) > occ(v') for any other number v'. For example, arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], [11, 11] and [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] are dominated (by 2, 11 and 3 respectevitely) but arrays [3], [1, 2] and [3, 3, 2, 2, 1] are not.Small remark: since any array can be dominated only by one number, we can not specify this number and just say that array is either dominated or not.You are given array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Calculate its shortest dominated subarray or say that there are no such subarrays.The subarray of a is a contiguous part of the array a, i. e. the array a_i, a_{i + 1}, \dots, a_j for some 1 \le i \le j \le n.
218	Yet Another Monster Killing Problem You play a computer game. In this game, you lead a party of m heroes, and you have to clear a dungeon with n monsters. Each monster is characterized by its power a_i. Each hero is characterized by his power p_i and endurance s_i.The heroes clear the dungeon day by day. In the beginning of each day, you choose a hero (exactly one) who is going to enter the dungeon this day.When the hero enters the dungeon, he is challenged by the first monster which was not defeated during the previous days (so, if the heroes have already defeated k monsters, the hero fights with the monster k + 1). When the hero fights the monster, there are two possible outcomes:After defeating a monster, the hero either continues fighting with the next monster or leaves the dungeon. He leaves the dungeon either if he has already defeated the number of monsters equal to his endurance during this day (so, the i-th hero cannot defeat more than s_i monsters during each day), or if all monsters are defeated — otherwise, he fights with the next monster. When the hero leaves the dungeon, the current day ends.Your goal is to defeat the last monster. What is the minimum number of days that you need to achieve your goal? Each day you have to use exactly one hero; it is possible that some heroes don't fight the monsters at all. Each hero can be used arbitrary number of times.
219	The Contest A team of three programmers is going to play a contest. The contest consists of n problems, numbered from 1 to n. Each problem is printed on a separate sheet of paper. The participants have decided to divide the problem statements into three parts: the first programmer took some prefix of the statements (some number of first paper sheets), the third contestant took some suffix of the statements (some number of last paper sheets), and the second contestant took all remaining problems. But something went wrong — the statements were printed in the wrong order, so the contestants have received the problems in some random order.The first contestant has received problems a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \dots, a_{1, k_1}. The second one has received problems a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{2, k_2}. The third one has received all remaining problems (a_{3, 1}, a_{3, 2}, \dots, a_{3, k_3}).The contestants don't want to play the contest before they redistribute the statements. They want to redistribute them so that the first contestant receives some prefix of the problemset, the third contestant receives some suffix of the problemset, and the second contestant receives all the remaining problems.During one move, some contestant may give one of their problems to other contestant. What is the minimum number of moves required to redistribute the problems?.
220	Make Them Similar Let's call two numbers  if their binary representations contain the same number of digits equal to 1. For example:You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You may choose a non-negative integer x, and then get another array of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where b_i = a_i \oplus x (\oplus denotes bitwise XOR).Is it possible to obtain an array b where all numbers are similar to each other?
221	Cut and Paste We start with a string s consisting only of the digits 1, 2, or 3. The length of s is denoted by |s|. For each i from 1 to |s|, the i-th character of s is denoted by s_i. There is one cursor. The cursor's location \ell is denoted by an integer in \{0, \ldots, |s|\}, with the following meaning: We denote by s_\text{left} the string to the left of the cursor and s_\text{right} the string to the right of the cursor. We also have a string c, which we call our , which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:The cursor initially starts at \ell = 0. Then, we perform the following procedure:You're given the initial string s and the integer x. What is the length of s when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo 10^9 + 7. It is guaranteed that \ell \le |s| at any time.
222	Beingawesomeism You are an all-powerful being and you have created a rectangular world. In fact, your world is so bland that it could be represented by a r \times c grid. Each cell on the grid represents a country. Each country has a dominant religion. There are only two religions in your world. One of the religions is called Beingawesomeism, who do good for the sake of being good. The other religion is called Pushingittoofarism, who do murders for the sake of being bad.Oh, and you are actually not really all-powerful. You just have one power, which you can use infinitely many times! Your power involves . When a missionary group of a certain country, say a, passes by another country b, they change the dominant religion of country b to the dominant religion of country a.In particular, a single use of your power is this: The following image illustrates one possible single usage of your power. Here,  represents a country with dominant religion Beingawesomeism and  represents a country with dominant religion Pushingittoofarism. Here, we've chosen a 1 \times 4 subgrid, the direction NORTH, and s = 2 steps. You are a being which believes in free will, for the most part. However, you just really want to stop receiving murders that are attributed to your name. Hence, you decide to use your powers and try to make Beingawesomeism the dominant religion in every country.What is the minimum number of usages of your power needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism?With god, nothing is impossible. But maybe you're not god? If it is impossible to make Beingawesomeism the dominant religion in all countries, you must also admit your mortality and say so.
223	Jeremy Bearimy Welcome! Everything is fine.You have arrived in The Medium Place, the place between The Good Place and The Bad Place. You are assigned a task that will either make people happier or torture them for eternity.You have a list of k pairs of people who have arrived in a new inhabited neighborhood. You need to assign each of the 2k people into one of the 2k houses. Each person will be the resident of exactly one house, and each house will have exactly one resident.Of course, in the neighborhood, it is possible to visit friends. There are 2k - 1 roads, each of which connects two houses. It takes some time to traverse a road. We will specify the amount of time it takes in the input. The neighborhood is designed in such a way that from anyone's house, there is exactly one sequence of distinct roads you can take to any other house. In other words, the graph with the houses as vertices and the roads as edges is a tree.The truth is, these k pairs of people are actually soulmates. We index them from 1 to k. We denote by f(i) the amount of time it takes for the i-th pair of soulmates to go to each other's houses.As we have said before, you will need to assign each of the 2k people into one of the 2k houses. You have two missions, one from the entities in The Good Place and one from the entities of The Bad Place. Here they are:What are the values of G and B?
224	Miss Punyverse The Oak has n nesting places, numbered with integers from 1 to n. Nesting place i is home to b_i bees and w_i wasps.Some nesting places are connected by branches. We call two nesting places  if there exists a branch between them. A  from nesting place x to y is given by a sequence s_0, \ldots, s_p of distinct nesting places, where p is a non-negative integer, s_0 = x, s_p = y, and s_{i-1} and s_{i} are adjacent for each i = 1, \ldots, p. The branches of The Oak are set up in such a way that for any two pairs of nesting places x and y, there exists a unique simple path from x to y. Because of this, biologists and computer scientists agree that The Oak is in fact, a tree.A  is a  set V of nesting places such that for any two x and y in V, there exists a simple path from x to y whose intermediate nesting places all lie in V. A set of villages \cal P is called a  if each of the n nesting places is contained in exactly one of the villages in \cal P. In other words, no two villages in \cal P share any common nesting place, and altogether, they contain all n nesting places.The Oak holds its annual Miss Punyverse beauty pageant. The two contestants this year are Ugly Wasp and Pretty Bee. The winner of the beauty pageant is determined by voting, which we will now explain. Suppose \mathcal{P} is a partition of the nesting places into m villages V_1, \ldots, V_m. There is a local election in each village. Each of the insects in this village vote for their favorite contestant. If there are  more votes for Ugly Wasp than Pretty Bee, then Ugly Wasp is said to  in that village. Otherwise, Pretty Bee . Whoever wins in the most number of villages wins.As it always goes with these pageants, bees always vote for the bee (which is Pretty Bee this year) and wasps always vote for the wasp (which is Ugly Wasp this year). Unlike their general elections, no one abstains from voting for Miss Punyverse as everyone takes it very seriously.Mayor Waspacito, and his assistant Alexwasp, wants Ugly Wasp to win. He has the power to choose how to partition The Oak into exactly m villages. If he chooses the partition optimally, determine the maximum number of villages in which Ugly Wasp wins.
225	Kirchhoff's Current Loss Your friend Kirchhoff is shocked with the current state of electronics design."Ohmygosh! Watt is wrong with the field? All these circuits are inefficient! There's so much capacity for improvement. The electrical engineers must not conduct their classes very well. It's absolutely revolting" he said.The negativity just keeps flowing out of him, but even after complaining so many times he still hasn't lepton the chance to directly change anything."These circuits have too much total resistance. Wire they designed this way? It's just causing a massive loss of resistors! Their entire field could conserve so much money if they just maximized the potential of their designs. Why can't they just try alternative ideas?"The frequency of his protests about the electrical engineering department hertz your soul, so you have decided to take charge and help them yourself. You plan to create a program that will optimize the circuits while keeping the same circuit layout and maintaining the same effective resistance.A  has two endpoints, and is associated with a certain constant, R, called its . The circuits we'll consider will be formed from individual resistors joined together in  or in , forming more complex circuits. The following image illustrates combining circuits in series or parallel. According to your friend Kirchhoff, the effective resistance can be calculated quite easily when joining circuits this way: Circuits will be represented by strings. Individual resistors are represented by an asterisk, "". For more complex circuits, suppose s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k represent k \ge 2 circuits. Then:For example, "" represents the following circuit:Given a circuit, your task is to assign the resistances of the individual resistors such that they satisfy the following requirements:If there are n individual resistors, then you need to output the list r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n (0 \le r_i, and r_i is an integer), where r_i is the resistance assigned to the i-th individual resistor that appears in the input (from left to right). If it is impossible to accomplish the task, you must say so as well.If it is possible, then it is guaranteed that the minimum sum of resistances is at most 10^{18}. 
226	Intergalactic Sliding Puzzle You are an intergalactic surgeon and you have an alien patient. For the purposes of this problem, we can and we will model this patient's body using a 2 \times (2k + 1) rectangular grid. The alien has 4k + 1 distinct organs, numbered 1 to 4k + 1.In healthy such aliens, the organs are arranged in a particular way. For example, here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned, when viewed from the top, for k = 4:Here, the  represents empty space. In general, the first row contains organs 1 to 2k + 1 (in that order from left to right), and the second row contains organs 2k + 2 to 4k + 1 (in that order from left to right) and then empty space right after. Your patient's organs are complete, and inside their body, but they somehow got shuffled around! Your job, as an intergalactic surgeon, is to put everything back in its correct position. All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure. This means that at any point during the procedure, there is exactly one cell (in the grid) that is empty. In addition, you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things:Your job is to figure out a sequence of moves you must do during the surgical procedure in order to place back all 4k + 1 internal organs of your patient in the correct cells. If it is impossible to do so, you must say so.
227	Suffix Three We just discovered a new data structure in our research group: a !It's very useful for natural language processing. Given three languages and three suffixes, a suffix three can determine which language a sentence is written in.It's super simple, 100% accurate, and doesn't involve advanced machine learning algorithms.Let us tell you how it works.Given this, we need you to implement a suffix three that can differentiate Filipino, Japanese, and Korean.Oh, did I say three suffixes? I meant four.
228	Azamon Web Services Your friend Jeff Zebos has been trying to run his new online company, but it's not going very well. He's not getting a lot of sales on his website which he decided to call . His big problem, you think, is that he's not ranking high enough on the search engines. If only he could rename his products to have better names than his competitors, then he'll be at the top of the search results and will be a millionaire.After doing some research, you find out that search engines only sort their results lexicographically. If your friend could rename his products to lexicographically smaller strings than his competitor's, then he'll be at the top of the rankings!To make your strategy less obvious to his competitors, you decide to swap no more than two letters of the product names.Please help Jeff to find improved names for his products that are lexicographically smaller than his competitor's!Given the string s representing Jeff's product name and the string c representing his competitor's product name, find a way to swap  of characters in s (that is, find two distinct indices i and j and swap s_i and s_j) such that the resulting new name becomes strictly lexicographically smaller than c, or determine that it is impossible. String a is  than string b if and only if one of the following holds:
229	Temporarily unavailable Polycarp lives on the coordinate axis Ox and travels from the point x=a to x=b. It moves uniformly rectilinearly at a speed of one unit of distance per minute.On the axis Ox at the point x=c the base station of the mobile operator is placed. It is known that the radius of its coverage is r. Thus, if Polycarp is at a distance less than or equal to r from the point x=c, then he is in the network coverage area, otherwise — no. The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside it.Print the time in minutes during which Polycarp will  in the coverage area of the network, with a rectilinear uniform movement from x=a to x=b. His speed — one unit of distance per minute.
230	Petya and Exam Petya has come to the math exam and wants to solve as many problems as possible. He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.The exam consists of n problems that can be solved in T minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time 0 and ends at time T. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from 0 to T, inclusive.All problems are divided into two types: Thus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time x, then it will be solved at time x+a. Similarly, if at a time x Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time x+b.For every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time t_i (0 \le t_i \le T) at which it will become  (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time s and there is such a problem i that t_i \le s and he didn't solve it, then he will receive 0 points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which t_i \le s) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time s Petya can have both "mandatory" and "non-mandatory" problems solved.For example, if n=2, T=5, a=2, b=3, the first problem is hard and t_1=3 and the second problem is easy and t_2=2. Then:Thus, the answer to this test is 2.Help Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.
231	Enchanted Artifact After completing the last level of the enchanted temple, you received a powerful artifact of the 255th level. Do not rush to celebrate, because this artifact has a powerful rune that can be destroyed with a single  s, which you are going to find. We define the spell as some  consisting only of the letters  and .At any time, you can cast an arbitrary non-empty spell t, and the rune on the artifact will begin to resist.  of the rune is the edit distance between the strings that specify the casted spell t and the rune-destroying spell s. of two strings s and t is a value equal to the minimum number of one-character operations of replacing, inserting and deleting characters in s to get t. For example, the distance between  and  is 2, the distance between  and  is 1, the distance between  and  is 3. The edit distance is 0 if and only if the strings are equal.It is also worth considering that the artifact has a resistance limit  — if you cast more than n + 2 spells, where n is the length of spell s, the rune will be blocked.Thus, it takes n + 2 or fewer spells to destroy the rune that is on your artifact. Keep in mind that the required destructive spell s must also be counted among these n + 2 spells.Note that the length n of the rune-destroying spell s is not known to you in advance. It is only known that its length n does not exceed 300.
232	The Cake Is a Lie It is known that the cake was originally a regular n-sided polygon, each vertex of which had a unique number from 1 to n. The vertices were numbered in random order.Each piece of the cake is a triangle. The cake was cut into n - 2 pieces as follows: each time one cut was made with a knife (from one vertex to another) such that exactly one triangular piece was separated from the current cake, and the rest continued to be a convex polygon. In other words, each time three consecutive vertices of the polygon were selected and the corresponding triangle was cut off.A possible process of cutting the cake is presented in the picture below.You are given a set of n-2 triangular pieces in random order. The vertices of each piece are given in random order — clockwise or counterclockwise. Each piece is defined by three numbers — the numbers of the corresponding n-sided cake vertices.For example, for the situation in the picture above, you could be given a set of pieces: [3, 6, 5], [5, 2, 4], [5, 4, 6], [6, 3, 1].You are interested in two questions.Formally, you have to find two permutations p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n) and q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n - 2} (1 \le q_i \le n - 2) such that if the cake vertices are numbered with the numbers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n in order clockwise or counterclockwise, then when cutting pieces of the cake in the order q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{n - 2} always cuts off a triangular piece so that the remaining part forms one convex polygon.For example, in the picture above the answer permutations could be: p=[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5] (or any of its cyclic shifts, or its reversal and after that any cyclic shift) and q=[2, 4, 1, 3].Write a program that, based on the given triangular pieces, finds any suitable permutations p and q.
233	Minutes Before the New Year New Year is coming and you are excited to know how many minutes remain before the New Year. You know that currently the clock shows h hours and m minutes, where 0 \le hh < 24 and 0 \le mm < 60. Your task is to find the number of minutes before the New Year. You know that New Year comes when the clock shows 0 hours and 0 minutes.You have to answer t independent test cases.
234	Candies Division Santa has n candies and he wants to gift them to k kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all k kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has a candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has b candies. Then Santa will be , if the both conditions are met at the same time:\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor is k divided by 2 and rounded  to the nearest integer. For example, if k=5 then \lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor=\lfloor\frac{5}{2}\rfloor=2.Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be .You have to answer t independent test cases.
235	Friends and Gifts There are n friends who want to give gifts for the New Year to each other. Each friend should give  one gift and receive  one gift. The friend  give the gift to himself.For each friend the value f_i is known: it is either f_i = 0 if the i-th friend doesn't know whom he wants to give the gift to or 1 \le f_i \le n if the i-th friend wants to give the gift to the friend f_i.You want to fill in the unknown values (f_i = 0) in such a way that each friend gives  one gift and receives  one gift and there is  friend who gives the gift to himself. It is guaranteed that the initial information isn't contradictory.If there are several answers, you can print any.
236	Christmas Trees There are n Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The i-th tree grows at the position x_i. All x_i are guaranteed to be distinct.Each  point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by the human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by anything.There are m people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m be the positions of people (note that all values x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m should be  and all y_j should be ). You want to find such an arrangement of people that the value \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\min\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_j| is the minimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people should be minimized).In other words, let d_j be the distance from the j-th human to the nearest Christmas tree (d_j = \min\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_j - x_i|). Then you need to choose such positions y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m that \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} d_j is the minimum possible.
237	New Year Parties Oh, New Year. The time to gather all your friends and reflect on the heartwarming events of the past year...n friends live in a city which can be represented as a number line. The i-th friend lives in a house with an integer coordinate x_i. The i-th friend can come celebrate the New Year to the house with coordinate x_i-1, x_i+1 or stay at x_i. Each friend is allowed to move no more than once.For all friends 1 \le x_i \le n holds, however, they can come to houses with coordinates 0 and n+1 (if their houses are at 1 or n, respectively).For example, let the initial positions be x = [1, 2, 4, 4]. The final ones then can be [1, 3, 3, 4], [0, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 5, 5], [2, 1, 3, 5] and so on. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.So all friends choose the moves they want to perform. After that the number of occupied houses is calculated. What is the minimum and the maximum number of occupied houses can there be?
238	DIY Garland Polycarp has decided to decorate his room because the New Year is soon. One of the main decorations that Polycarp will install is the garland he is going to solder himself.Simple garlands consisting of several lamps connected by one wire are too boring for Polycarp. He is going to solder a garland consisting of n lamps and n - 1 wires. Exactly one lamp will be connected to power grid, and power will be transmitted from it to other lamps by the wires. Each wire connectes exactly two lamps; one lamp is called  for this wire (the one that gets power from some other wire and transmits it to this wire), the other one is called  (the one that gets power from this wire). Obviously, each lamp has at most one wire that brings power to it (and this lamp is the auxiliary lamp for this wire, and the main lamp for all other wires connected directly to it).Each lamp has a brightness value associated with it, the i-th lamp has brightness 2^i. We define the  of the wire as the sum of brightness values over all lamps that become disconnected from the grid if the wire is cut (and all other wires are still working).Polycarp has drawn the scheme of the garland he wants to make (the scheme depicts all n lamp and n - 1 wires, and the lamp that will be connected directly to the grid is marked; the wires are placed in such a way that the power can be transmitted to each lamp). After that, Polycarp calculated the importance of each wire, enumerated them from 1 to n - 1 in descending order of their importance, and then wrote the index of the main lamp for each wire (in the order from the first wire to the last one).The following day Polycarp bought all required components of the garland and decided to solder it — but he could not find the scheme. Fortunately, Polycarp found the list of indices of main lamps for all wires. Can you help him restore the original scheme?
239	New Year and Naming Happy new year! The year 2020 is also known as  (경자년, ) in Korea. Where did the name come from? Let's briefly look at the  system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.There are two sequences of n strings s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_{n} and m strings t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_{m}. These strings contain only lowercase letters. There might be duplicates among these strings.Let's call a concatenation of strings x and y as the string that is obtained by writing down strings x and y one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings "" and "" is the string "".The year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings s_1 and t_1. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences. If the string that is currently being used is at the end of its sequence, we go back to the first string in that sequence.For example, if n = 3, m = 4, s = , t = , the following table denotes the resulting year names. Note that the names of the years may repeat.You are given two sequences of strings of size n and m and also q queries. For each query, you will be given the current year. Could you find the name corresponding to the given year, according to the  system?
240	New Year and Ascent Sequence A sequence a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_l] of length l has an  if there exists a pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 \le i < j \le l and a_i < a_j. For example, the sequence [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] has an ascent because of the pair (1, 4), but the sequence [4, 3, 3, 3, 1] doesn't have an ascent.Let's call a concatenation of sequences p and q the sequence that is obtained by writing down sequences p and q one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] and [4, 3, 3, 3, 1] is the sequence [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1]. The concatenation of sequences p and q is denoted as p+q.Gyeonggeun thinks that sequences with ascents bring luck. Therefore, he wants to make many such sequences for the new year. Gyeonggeun has n sequences s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n which may have different lengths. Gyeonggeun will consider all n^2 pairs of sequences s_x and s_y (1 \le x, y \le n), and will check if its concatenation s_x + s_y has an ascent. Note that he may select the same sequence twice, and the order of selection matters.Please count the number of pairs (x, y) of sequences s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n whose concatenation s_x + s_y contains an ascent.
241	New Year and Permutation Recall that the permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the subsegments as [l, r], where l, r are two integers with 1 \le l \le r \le n. This indicates the subsegment where l-1 elements from the beginning and n-r elements from the end are deleted from the sequence.For a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n, we define a  as a subsegment [l,r] where \max\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r\} - \min\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r\} = r - l. For example, for the permutation (6, 7, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4) some of its framed segments are: [1, 2], [5, 8], [6, 7], [3, 3], [8, 8]. In particular, a subsegment [i,i] is always a framed segments for any i between 1 and n, inclusive.We define the  of a permutation p as the number of pairs (l, r) such that 1 \le l \le r \le n, and [l, r] is a framed segment. For example, the permutation [3, 1, 2] has happiness 5: all segments except [1, 2] are framed segments.Given integers n and m, Jongwon wants to compute the sum of happiness for all permutations of length n, modulo the prime number m. Note that there exist n! (factorial of n) different permutations of length n.
242	New Year and Conference Filled with optimism, Hyunuk will host a conference about how great this new year will be!The conference will have n lectures. Hyunuk has two candidate venues a and b. For each of the n lectures, the speaker specified two time intervals [sa_i, ea_i] (sa_i \le ea_i) and [sb_i, eb_i] (sb_i \le eb_i). If the conference is situated in venue a, the lecture will be held from sa_i to ea_i, and if the conference is situated in venue b, the lecture will be held from sb_i to eb_i. Hyunuk will choose one of these venues and  lectures will be held at that venue.Two lectures are said to overlap if they share any point in time in common. Formally, a lecture held in interval [x, y] overlaps with a lecture held in interval [u, v] if and only if \max(x, u) \le \min(y, v).We say that a participant can  a subset s of the lectures if the lectures in s do not pairwise overlap (i.e. no two lectures overlap). Note that the possibility of attending may depend on whether Hyunuk selected venue a or venue b to hold the conference.A subset of lectures s is said to be  if, for one of the venues, the participant can attend s, but for the other venue, the participant cannot attend s.A venue-sensitive set is problematic for a participant who is interested in attending the lectures in s because the participant cannot be sure whether the lecture times will overlap. Hyunuk will be happy if and only if there are no venue-sensitive sets. Determine whether Hyunuk will be happy.
243	New Year and Castle Construction Kiwon's favorite video game is now holding a new year event to motivate the users! The game is about building and defending a castle, which led Kiwon to think about the following puzzle.In a 2-dimension plane, you have a set s = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\} consisting of n distinct points. In the set s, . For a point p \in s, we can protect this point by building a castle. A  is a simple quadrilateral (polygon with 4 vertices) that strictly encloses the point p (i.e. the point p is strictly inside a quadrilateral). Kiwon is interested in the number of 4-point subsets of s that can be used to build a castle protecting p. Note that, if a single subset can be connected in more than one way to enclose a point, it is counted only once. Let f(p) be the number of 4-point subsets that can enclose the point p. Please compute the sum of f(p) for all points p \in s.
244	New Year and Social Network Donghyun's new social network service (SNS) contains n users numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n. Internally, their network is a , so there are n-1 direct connections between each user. Each user can reach every other users by using some sequence of direct connections. From now on, we will denote this primary network as T_1.To prevent a possible server breakdown, Donghyun created a backup network T_2, which also connects the same n users via a tree graph. If a system breaks down, exactly one edge e \in T_1 becomes unusable. In this case, Donghyun will protect the edge e by picking another edge f \in T_2, and add it to the existing network. This new edge should make the network be connected again. Donghyun wants to assign a replacement edge f \in T_2 for as many edges e \in T_1 as possible. However, since the backup network T_2 is fragile, f \in T_2 can be assigned as the replacement edge for at most one edge in T_1. With this restriction, Donghyun wants to protect as many edges in T_1 as possible.Formally, let E(T) be an edge set of the tree T. We consider a bipartite graph with two parts E(T_1) and E(T_2). For e \in E(T_1), f \in E(T_2), there is an edge connecting \{e, f\} if and only if graph T_1 - \{e\} + \{f\} is a tree. You should find a maximum matching in this bipartite graph.
245	Mezo Playing Zoma Today, Mezo is playing a game. Zoma, a character in that game, is initially at position x = 0. Mezo starts sending n commands to Zoma. There are two possible commands:Unfortunately, Mezo's controller malfunctions sometimes. Some commands are sent successfully and some are ignored. If the command is ignored then the position x doesn't change and Mezo simply proceeds to the next command.For example, if Mezo sends commands "", then here are some possible outcomes (underlined commands are sent successfully): Mezo doesn't know which commands will be sent successfully beforehand. Thus, he wants to know how many different positions may Zoma end up at.
246	Just Eat It! Today, Yasser and Adel are at the shop buying cupcakes. There are n cupcake types, arranged from 1 to n on the shelf, and there are infinitely many of each type. The tastiness of a cupcake of type i is an integer a_i. There are both tasty and nasty cupcakes, so the tastiness can be positive, zero or negative.Yasser, of course, wants to try them all, so he will buy exactly one cupcake of each type.On the other hand, Adel will choose some segment [l, r] (1 \le l \le r \le n) that does not include all of cupcakes (he can't choose [l, r] = [1, n]) and buy exactly one cupcake of each of types l, l + 1, \dots, r.After that they will compare the total tastiness of the cupcakes each of them have bought. Yasser will be happy if the total tastiness of cupcakes he buys is  greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys .For example, let the tastinesses of the cupcakes be [7, 4, -1]. Yasser will buy all of them, the total tastiness will be 7 + 4 - 1 = 10. Adel can choose segments [7], [4], [-1], [7, 4] or [4, -1], their total tastinesses are 7, 4, -1, 11 and 3, respectively. Adel can choose segment with tastiness 11, and as 10 is not strictly greater than 11, Yasser won't be happy :(Find out if Yasser will be happy after visiting the shop.
247	Fadi and LCM Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer X, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of max(a, b) such that LCM(a, b) equals X. Both a and b should be positive integers.LCM(a, b) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. For example, LCM(6, 8) = 24, LCM(4, 12) = 12, LCM(2, 3) = 6.Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?
248	Evil Underscores Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 \leq i \leq n}{\max} (a_i \oplus X) is minimum possible, where \oplus denotes the .As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 \leq i \leq n}{\max} (a_i \oplus X).
249	Delete a Segment There are n segments on a Ox axis [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_n, r_n]. Segment [l, r] covers all points from l to r inclusive, so all x such that l \le x \le r.Segments can be placed   — be inside each other, coincide and so on. Segments can degenerate into points, that is l_i=r_i is possible. of the set of segments is such a set of segments which covers exactly the same set of points as the original set. For example:Obviously, a union is a set of pairwise non-intersecting segments.You are asked to erase exactly one segment of the given n so that the number of segments in the union of the rest n-1 segments is maximum possible.For example, if n=4 and there are segments [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 7], then:Thus, you are required to erase the third segment to get answer 2.Write a program that will find the maximum number of segments in the union of n-1 segments if you erase any of the given n segments.
250	Classical? Given an array a, consisting of n integers, find:\max\limits_{1 \le i < j \le n} LCM(a_i,a_j),where LCM(x, y) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both x and y. For example, LCM(6, 8) = 24, LCM(4, 12) = 12, LCM(2, 3) = 6.
251	Garland Vadim loves decorating the Christmas tree, so he got a beautiful garland as a present. It consists of n light bulbs in a single row. Each bulb has a number from 1 to n (in arbitrary order), such that all the numbers are distinct. While Vadim was solving problems, his home Carp removed some light bulbs from the garland. Now Vadim wants to put them back on.Vadim wants to put all bulb back on the garland. Vadim defines  of a garland to be the number of pairs of adjacent bulbs with numbers with different parity (remainder of the division by 2). For example, the complexity of  is 2 and the complexity of  is 1.No one likes complexity, so Vadim wants to minimize the number of such pairs. Find the way to put all bulbs back on the garland, such that the complexity is as small as possible.
252	Numbers on Tree Evlampiy was gifted a rooted tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to n. Each of its vertices also has an integer a_i written on it. For each vertex i, Evlampiy calculated c_i — the number of vertices j in the subtree of vertex i, such that a_j < a_i. After the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of c_i, but he completely forgot which integers a_i were written on the vertices.Help him to restore initial integers!
253	LCC An infinitely long Line Chillland Collider (LCC) was built in Chillland. There are n pipes with coordinates x_i that are connected to LCC. When the experiment starts at time 0, i-th proton flies from the i-th pipe with speed v_i. It flies to the right with probability p_i and flies to the left with probability (1 - p_i). The  is determined as the time of the first collision of any two protons. In case there is no collision, the duration of the experiment is considered to be zero.Find the expected value of the duration of the experiment.
254	Fedya the Potter Strikes Back Fedya has a string S, initially empty, and an array W, also initially empty.There are n queries to process, one at a time. Query i consists of a lowercase English letter c_i and a nonnegative integer w_i. First, c_i must be appended to S, and w_i must be appended to W. The answer to the query is the sum of  for all subsegments of W [L, \ R], (1 \leq L \leq R \leq i).We define the  of a subsegment as follows: if the substring of S corresponding to this subsegment (that is, a string of consecutive characters from L-th to R-th, inclusive) matches the prefix of S of the same length (that is, a substring corresponding to the subsegment [1, \ R - L + 1]), then its suspiciousness is equal to the minimum in the array W on the [L, \ R] subsegment. Otherwise, in case the substring does not match the corresponding prefix, the suspiciousness is 0.Help Fedya answer all the queries before the orderlies come for him!
255	Harry The Potter To defeat Lord Voldemort, Harry needs to destroy all horcruxes first. The last horcrux is an array a of n integers, which also needs to be destroyed. The array is considered destroyed if all its elements are zeroes. To destroy the array, Harry can perform two types of operations:Note that x does not have to be positive.Harry is in a hurry, please help him to find the minimum number of operations required to destroy the array and exterminate Lord Voldemort.
256	Angry Students It's a walking tour day in SIS.Winter, so t groups of students are visiting Torzhok. Streets of Torzhok are so narrow that students have to go in a row one after another.Initially, some students are angry. Let's describe a group of students by a string of capital letters "" and "": Such string describes the row from the last to the first student.Every minute every angry student throws a snowball at the next student. Formally, if an angry student corresponds to the character with index i in the string describing a group then they will throw a snowball at the student that corresponds to the character with index i+1 (students are given from the last to the first student). If the target student was not angry yet, they become angry. Even if the first (the rightmost in the string) student is angry, they don't throw a snowball since there is no one in front of them.Let's look at the first example test. The row initially looks like this: . Then, after a minute the only single angry student will throw a snowball at the student in front of them, and they also become angry: . After that, no more students will become angry.Your task is to help SIS.Winter teachers to determine the last moment a student becomes angry for every group.
257	Hyperset Bees Alice and Alesya gave beekeeper Polina famous card game "Set" as a Christmas present. The deck consists of cards that vary in four features across three options for each kind of feature: number of shapes, shape, shading, and color. In this game, some combinations of three cards are said to make up a . For every feature — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either all the same, or pairwise different. The picture below shows how sets look.Polina came up with a new game called "Hyperset". In her game, there are n cards with k features, each feature has three possible values: "", "", or "". The original "Set" game can be viewed as "Hyperset" with k = 4.Similarly to the original game, three cards form a , if all features are the same for all cards or are pairwise different. The goal of the game is to compute the number of ways to choose three cards that form a .Unfortunately, winter holidays have come to an end, and it's time for Polina to go to school. Help Polina find the number of sets among the cards lying on the table.
258	Deadline Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has n days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for d days to calculate the results.Fortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends x (x is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in \left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil days (\left\lceil a \right\rceil is the ceiling function: \left\lceil 2.4 \right\rceil = 3, \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to x + \left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil.Will Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than n days?
259	Yet Another Meme Problem Try guessing the statement from this picture .You are given two integers A and B, calculate the number of pairs (a, b) such that 1 \le a \le A, 1 \le b \le B, and the equation a \cdot b + a + b = conc(a, b) is true; conc(a, b) is the concatenation of a and b (for example, conc(12, 23) = 1223, conc(100, 11) = 10011). .
260	Two Arrays You are given two integers n and m. Calculate the number of pairs of arrays (a, b) such that:As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9+7.
261	Minimax Problem You are given n arrays a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; each array consists of exactly m integers. We denote the y-th element of the x-th array as a_{x, y}.You have to choose two arrays a_i and a_j (1 \le i, j \le n, it is possible that i = j). After that, you will obtain a new array b consisting of m integers, such that for every k \in [1, m] b_k = \max(a_{i, k}, a_{j, k}).Your goal is to choose i and j so that the value of \min \limits_{k = 1}^{m} b_k is maximum possible.
262	Messenger Simulator Polycarp is a frequent user of the very popular messenger. He's chatting with his friends all the time. He has n friends, numbered from 1 to n.Recall that a permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array.So his recent chat list can be represented with a permutation p of size n. p_1 is the most recent friend Polycarp talked to, p_2 is the second most recent and so on.Initially, Polycarp's recent chat list p looks like 1, 2, \dots, n (in other words, it is an identity permutation).After that he receives m messages, the j-th message comes from the friend a_j. And that causes friend a_j to move to the first position in a permutation, shifting everyone between the first position and the current position of a_j by 1. Note that if the friend a_j is in the first position already then nothing happens.For example, let the recent chat list be p = [4, 1, 5, 3, 2]: For each friend consider all position he has been at in the beginning and after receiving each message. Polycarp wants to know what were the minimum and the maximum positions.
263	Red-Blue Graph You are given a bipartite graph: the first part of this graph contains n_1 vertices, the second part contains n_2 vertices, and there are m edges. .Initially, each edge is colorless. For each edge, you may either leave it uncolored (it is free), paint it red (it costs r coins) or paint it blue (it costs b coins). No edge can be painted red and blue simultaneously.There are three types of vertices in this graph — colorless, red and blue. Colored vertices impose additional constraints on edges' colours:Colorless vertices impose no additional constraints.Your goal is to paint some (possibly none) edges so that all constraints are met, and among all ways to do so, you should choose the one with minimum total cost. 
264	Mind Control You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.You are standing in the m-th position in the line. , you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. .Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be  x?Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice , and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.
265	Irreducible Anagrams Let's call two strings s and t  of each other if it is possible to rearrange symbols in the string s to get a string, equal to t.Let's consider two strings s and t . We say that t is a  of s if there exists an integer k \ge 2 and 2k non-empty strings s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \dots, s_k, t_k that satisfy the following conditions:If such strings don't exist, then t is said to be an  of s. .For example, consider the string s =  "". Then the string t =  "" is a reducible anagram of s, we may choose for example s_1 =  "", s_2 =  "", s_3 =  "" and t_1 =  "", t_2 =  "", t_3 =  "":On the other hand, we can prove that t =  "" is an irreducible anagram of s.You will be given a string s and q queries, represented by two integers 1 \le l \le r \le |s| (where |s| is equal to the length of the string s). For each query, you should find if the substring of s formed by characters from the l-th to the r-th has  irreducible anagram.
266	Prefix Enlightenment There are n lamps on a line, numbered from 1 to n. Each one has an initial state off (0) or on (1).You're given k subsets A_1, \ldots, A_k of \{1, 2, \dots, n\}, such that the intersection of any three subsets is empty. In other words, for all 1 \le i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \le k, A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap A_{i_3} = \varnothing.In one operation, you can choose one of these k subsets and switch the state of all lamps in it. It is guaranteed that, with the given subsets, it's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using this type of operation.Let m_i be the minimum number of operations you have to do in order to make the i first lamps be simultaneously on. Note that there is no condition upon the state of other lamps (between i+1 and n), they can be either off or on.You have to compute m_i for all 1 \le i \le n.
267	Coffee Varieties (hard version) You're considering moving to another city, where one of your friends already lives. There are n cafés in this city, where n is a power of two. The i-th café produces a single variety of coffee a_i. As you're a coffee-lover, before deciding to move or not,  produced in this city.You don't know the values a_1, \ldots, a_n. Fortunately, your friend has a memory of size k, where k is a power of two.Once per day, you can ask him to taste a cup of coffee produced by the café c, and he will tell you if he tasted a similar coffee during the last k days.You can also ask him to take a medication that will reset his memory. He will forget all previous cups of coffee tasted. You can reset his memory at most 30\ 000 times.More formally, the memory of your friend is a queue S. Doing a query on café c will: Doing a reset request will pop all elements out of S.Your friend can taste at most \dfrac{3n^2}{2k} cups of coffee in total. Find the diversity d (number of distinct values in the array a).Note that asking your friend to reset his memory  towards the number of times you ask your friend to taste a cup of coffee.In some test cases the behavior of the interactor . It means that the array a may be  before the start of the interaction and may . It is guaranteed that at any moment of the interaction, there is at least one array a consistent with all the answers given so far.
268	Cartesian Tree  Ildar is the algorithm teacher of William and Harris. Today, Ildar is teaching Cartesian Tree. However, Harris is sick, so Ildar is only teaching William.A cartesian tree is a rooted tree, that can be constructed from a sequence of distinct integers. We build the cartesian tree as follows:For example, this is the cartesian tree for the sequence 4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1:After teaching what the cartesian tree is, Ildar has assigned homework. He starts with an empty sequence a.In the i-th round, he inserts an element with value i somewhere in a. Then, he asks a question: what is the sum of the sizes of the subtrees for every node in the cartesian tree for the current sequence a?Node v is in the node u subtree if and only if v = u or v is in the subtree of one of the vertex u children. The size of the subtree of node u is the number of nodes v such that v is in the subtree of u.Ildar will do n rounds in total. The homework is the sequence of answers to the n questions.The next day, Ildar told Harris that he has to complete the homework as well. Harris obtained the final state of the sequence a from William. However, he has no idea how to find the answers to the n questions. Help Harris!
269	Making Shapes You are given n pairwise non-collinear two-dimensional vectors. You can make shapes in the two-dimensional plane with these vectors in the following fashion:You can reuse a vector as many times as you want.Count the number of different, non-degenerate (with an area greater than 0) and convex shapes made from applying the steps, such that the shape can be contained within a m \times m square, and the vectors building the shape are in counter-clockwise fashion. Since this number can be too large, you should calculate it by modulo 998244353.Two shapes are considered the same if there exists some parallel translation of the first shape to another.A shape can be contained within a m \times m square if there exists some parallel translation of this shape so that every point (u, v) inside or on the border of the shape satisfies 0 \leq u, v \leq m.
270	Even But Not Even Let's define a number  if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by 2 but the number itself is not divisible by 2. For example, 13, 1227, 185217 are  numbers, while 12, 2, 177013, 265918 are not. If you're still unsure what  numbers are, you can look at the sample notes for more clarification.You are given a non-negative integer s, consisting of n digits. You can delete some digits (they are  necessary consecutive/successive) to make the given number . You cannot change the order of the digits, that is, after deleting the digits the remaining digits collapse. The resulting number shouldn't contain leading zeros. You can delete any number of digits between 0 (do not delete any digits at all) and n-1.For example, if you are given s= then one of possible ways to make it  is:  \rightarrow . The sum of digits of  is equal to 70 and is divisible by 2, but number itself is not divisible by 2: it means that the resulting number is .Find  resulting number that is . If it's impossible to create an  number from the given number report about it.
271	Array Sharpening You're given an array a_1, \ldots, a_n of n non-negative integers.Let's call it  if and only if there exists an integer 1 \le k \le n such that a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > \ldots > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is . For example:You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any  element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 \le i \le n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.Tell if it's possible to make the given array  using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.
272	Coffee Varieties (easy version) You're considering moving to another city, where one of your friends already lives. There are n cafés in this city, where n is a power of two. The i-th café produces a single variety of coffee a_i. As you're a coffee-lover, before deciding to move or not,  produced in this city.You don't know the values a_1, \ldots, a_n.

Find the diversity d (number of distinct values in the array a).Note that asking your friend to reset his memory  towards the number of times you ask your friend to taste a cup of coffee.In some test cases the behavior of the interactor . It means that the array a may be  before the start of the interaction and may . It is guaranteed that at any moment of the interaction, there is at least one array a consistent with all the answers given so far.
273	NEKO's Maze Game NEKO#ΦωΦ has just got a new maze game on her PC!The game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a 2 \times n rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell (1, 1) to the gate at (2, n) and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.However, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.After hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only q such moments: the i-th moment toggles the state of cell (r_i, c_i) (either from ground to lava or vice versa).Knowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the q moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n) without going through any lava cells.Although NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?
274	Aroma's Search With a new body, our idol Aroma White (or should we call her Kaori Minamiya?) begins to uncover her lost past through the OS space.The space can be considered a 2D plane, with an infinite number of data nodes, indexed from 0, with their coordinates defined as follows:Initially Aroma stands at the point (x_s, y_s). She can stay in OS space for at most t seconds, because after this time she has to warp back to the real world. She  need to return to the entry point (x_s, y_s) to warp home.While within the OS space, Aroma can do the following actions:Aroma wants to collect as many data as possible before warping back. Can you help her in calculating the maximum number of data nodes she could collect within t seconds?
275	Xenon's Attack on the Gangs On another floor of the A.R.C. Markland-N, the young man Simon "Xenon" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker "X" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.His target is a network of n small gangs. This network contains exactly n - 1 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n - 2 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:S = \sum_{1 \leq u < v \leq n} mex(u, v)Here, mex(u, v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of S, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible S before he returns?
276	Chaotic V. The emotion samples are now sufficient. After almost 3 years, it's time for Ivy to awake her bonded sister, Vanessa.The system inside A.R.C.'s Library core can be considered as an undirected graph with infinite number of processing nodes, numbered with all positive integers (1, 2, 3, \ldots). The node with a number x (x > 1), is directly connected with a node with number \frac{x}{f(x)}, with f(x) being the lowest prime divisor of x.Vanessa's mind is divided into n fragments. Due to more than 500 years of coma, the fragments have been scattered: the i-th fragment is now located at the node with a number k_i! (a factorial of k_i).To maximize the chance of successful awakening, Ivy decides to place the samples in a node P, so that the total length of paths from each fragment to P is smallest possible. If there are multiple fragments located at the same node, the path from that node to P needs to be counted multiple times.In the world of zeros and ones, such a requirement is very simple for Ivy. Not longer than a second later, she has already figured out such a node.But for a mere human like you, is this still possible?For simplicity, please answer the minimal sum of paths' lengths from every fragment to the emotion samples' assembly node P.
277	Rin and The Unknown Flower On a normal day at the hidden office in A.R.C. Markland-N, Rin received an artifact, given to her by the exploration captain Sagar.After much analysis, she now realizes that this artifact contains data about a strange flower, which has existed way before the New Age. However, the information about its chemical structure has been encrypted heavily.The chemical structure of this flower can be represented as a string p. From the unencrypted papers included, Rin already knows the length n of that string, and she can also conclude that the string contains at most three distinct letters: "" (as in Carbon), "" (as in Hydrogen), and "" (as in Oxygen).At each moment, Rin can input a string s of an arbitrary length into the artifact's terminal, and it will return every starting position of s as a  of p.However, the artifact has limited energy and cannot be recharged in any way, since the technology is way too ancient and is incompatible with any current A.R.C.'s devices. To be specific:Since the artifact is so precious yet fragile, Rin is very nervous to attempt to crack the final data. Can you give her a helping hand?
278	Nora's Toy Boxes Back in time, the seven-year-old Nora used to play lots of games with her creation ROBO_Head-02, both to have fun and enhance his abilities.One day, Nora's adoptive father, Phoenix Wyle, brought Nora n boxes of toys. Before unpacking, Nora decided to make a fun game for ROBO.She labelled all n boxes with n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and asked ROBO to do the following action several (possibly zero) times:Being amused after nine different tries of the game, Nora asked ROBO to calculate the number of possible different piles having the  amount of boxes in them. Two piles are considered different if there exists a position where those two piles have different boxes.Since ROBO was still in his infant stages, and Nora was still too young to concentrate for a long time, both fell asleep before finding the final answer. Can you help them?As the number of such piles can be very large, you should print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
279	Markland-N A.R.C. Markland-N is a tall building with n floors numbered from 1 to n. Between each two adjacent floors in the building, there is a staircase connecting them.It's lunchtime for our sensei Colin "ConneR" Neumann Jr, and he's planning for a location to enjoy his meal.ConneR's office is at floor s of the building. On each floor (including floor s, of course), there is a restaurant offering meals. However, due to renovations being in progress, k of the restaurants are currently closed, and as a result, ConneR can't enjoy his lunch there.CooneR wants to reach a restaurant as quickly as possible to save time. What is the minimum number of staircases he needs to walk to reach a closest currently open restaurant.Please answer him quickly, and you might earn his praise and even enjoy the lunch with him in the elegant Neumanns' way!
280	JOE is on TV! Our dear Cafe's owner, JOE Miller, will soon take part in a new game TV-show "1 vs. n"!The game goes in rounds, where in each round the host asks JOE and his opponents a common question. All participants failing to answer are eliminated. The show ends when only JOE remains (we assume that JOE never answers a question wrong!).For each question JOE answers, if there are s (s > 0) opponents remaining and t (0 \le t \le s) of them make a mistake on it, JOE receives \displaystyle\frac{t}{s} dollars, and consequently there will be s - t opponents left for the next question.JOE wonders what is the maximum possible reward he can receive in the best possible scenario. Yet he has little time before show starts, so can you help him answering it instead?
281	Collecting Coins Polycarp has three sisters: Alice, Barbara, and Cerene. They're collecting coins. Currently, Alice has a coins, Barbara has b coins and Cerene has c coins. Recently Polycarp has returned from the trip around the world and brought n coins.He wants to distribute  these n coins between his sisters in such a way that the number of coins Alice has is equal to the number of coins Barbara has and is equal to the number of coins Cerene has. In other words, if Polycarp gives A coins to Alice, B coins to Barbara and C coins to Cerene (A+B+C=n), then a + A = b + B = c + C. that A, B or C (the number of coins Polycarp gives to Alice, Barbara and Cerene correspondingly) can be 0.Your task is to find out if it is possible to distribute  n coins between sisters in a way described above.You have to answer t independent test cases.
282	Collecting Packages There is a robot in a warehouse and n packages he wants to collect. The warehouse can be represented as a coordinate grid. Initially, the robot stays at the point (0, 0). The i-th package is at the point (x_i, y_i). It is guaranteed that there are no two packages at the same point. It is also guaranteed that the point (0, 0) doesn't contain a package.The robot is semi-broken and only can move up ('') and right (''). In other words, in one move the robot can go from the point (x, y) to the point (x + 1, y) or to the point (x, y + 1).As we say above, the robot wants to collect all n packages (). He wants to do it with the minimum possible number of moves. If there are several possible traversals, the robot wants to choose the lexicographically smallest path.The string s of length n is lexicographically less than the string t of length n if there is some index 1 \le j \le n that for all i from 1 to j-1 s_i = t_i and s_j < t_j. It is the standard comparison of string, like in a dictionary. Most programming languages compare strings in this way.
283	Product of Three Numbers You are given one integer number n. Find three  a, b, c such that 2 \le a, b, c and a \cdot b \cdot c = n or say that it is impossible to do it.If there are several answers, you can print any.You have to answer t independent test cases.
284	MEX maximizing Recall that  of an array is a  that does not belong to the array. Examples:You are given an empty array a=[] (in other words, a zero-length array). You are also given a positive integer x.You are also given q queries. The j-th query consists of one integer y_j and means that you have to append one element y_j to the array. The array length increases by 1 after a query.In one move, you can choose any index i and set a_i := a_i + x or a_i := a_i - x (i.e. increase or decrease any element of the array by x). The only restriction is that . Since initially the array is empty, you can perform moves only after the first query.You have to maximize the  (minimum excluded) of the array if you can perform any number of such operations (you can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).You have to find the answer after each of q queries (i.e. the j-th answer corresponds to the array of length j).
285	Obtain a Permutation You are given a rectangular matrix of size n \times m consisting of integers from 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5.In one move, you can:A cyclic shift is an operation such that you choose some j (1 \le j \le m) and set a_{1, j} := a_{2, j}, a_{2, j} := a_{3, j}, \dots, a_{n, j} := a_{1, j} .You want to perform the minimum number of moves to make this matrix look like this:In other words, the goal is to obtain the matrix, where a_{1, 1} = 1, a_{1, 2} = 2, \dots, a_{1, m} = m, a_{2, 1} = m + 1, a_{2, 2} = m + 2, \dots, a_{n, m} = n \cdot m (i.e. a_{i, j} = (i - 1) \cdot m + j) with the  performed.
286	Three Paths on a Tree You are given an unweighted tree with n vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.Your task is to choose  vertices a, b, c on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to  one of the simple paths between a and b, b and c, or a and c is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.
287	Display The Number You have a large electronic screen which can display up to 998244353 decimal digits. The digits are displayed in the same way as on different electronic alarm clocks: each place for a digit consists of 7 segments which can be turned on and off to compose different digits. The following picture describes how you can display all 10 decimal digits:As you can see, different digits may require different number of segments to be turned on. For example, if you want to display 1, you have to turn on 2 segments of the screen, and if you want to display 8, all 7 segments of some place to display a digit should be turned on.You want to display a really large integer on the screen. Unfortunately, the screen is bugged: no more than n segments can be turned on simultaneously. So now you wonder what is the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than n segments.Your program should be able to process t different test cases.
288	Infinite Prefixes You are given string s of length n consisting of -s and -s. You build an infinite string t as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings s, or t = ssss \dots For example, if s = , then t = ...Calculate the number of prefixes of t with  equal to x. The balance of some string q is equal to cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}, where cnt_{0, q} is the number of occurrences of  in q, and cnt_{1, q} is the number of occurrences of  in q. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".
289	Obtain The String You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Also you have a string z which is initially empty. You want string z to be equal to string t. You can perform the following operation to achieve this: append any subsequence of s at the end of string z. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if z = ac, s = abcde, you may turn z into following strings in one operation: Note that after this operation string s doesn't change.Calculate the minimum number of such operations to turn string z into string t. 
290	Same GCDs You are given two integers a and m. Calculate the number of integers x such that 0 \le x < m and \gcd(a, m) = \gcd(a + x, m).Note: \gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
291	Permutation Separation You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n (an array where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once). The weight of the i-th element of this permutation is a_i.At first, you separate your permutation into two  sets — prefix and suffix. More formally, the first set contains elements p_1, p_2, \dots , p_k, the second — p_{k+1}, p_{k+2}, \dots , p_n, where 1 \le k < n.After that, you may move elements between sets. The operation you are allowed to do is to choose some element of the first set and move it to the second set, or vice versa (move from the second set to the first). You have to pay a_i dollars to move the element p_i.Your goal is to make it so that each element of the first set is less than each element of the second set. Note that if one of the sets is empty, this condition is met.For example, if p = [3, 1, 2] and a = [7, 1, 4], then the optimal strategy is: separate p into two parts [3, 1] and [2] and then move the 2-element into first set (it costs 4). And if p = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4], a = [9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9], then the optimal strategy is: separate p into two parts [3, 5, 1] and [6, 2, 4], and then move the 2-element into first set (it costs 1), and 5-element into second set (it also costs 1).Calculate the minimum number of dollars you have to spend.
292	Good Contest An online contest will soon be held on ForceCoders, a large competitive programming platform. The authors have prepared n problems; and since the platform is very popular, 998244351 coder from all over the world is going to solve them.For each problem, the authors estimated the number of people who would solve it: for the i-th problem, the number of accepted solutions will be between l_i and r_i, inclusive.The creator of ForceCoders uses different criteria to determine if the contest is good or bad. One of these criteria is the number of inversions in the problem order. An inversion is a pair of problems (x, y) such that x is located earlier in the contest (x < y), but the number of accepted solutions for y is  greater.Obviously, both the creator of ForceCoders and the authors of the contest want the contest to be good. Now they want to calculate the probability that there will be  inversions in the problem order, assuming that for each problem i, any  number of accepted solutions for it (between l_i and r_i) is equally probable, and all these numbers are independent.
293	Array with Odd Sum You are given an array a consisting of n integers.In one move, you can choose two indices 1 \le i, j \le n such that i \ne j and set a_i := a_j. You can perform such moves any number of times (possibly, zero). You can choose different indices in different operations. The operation := is the operation of assignment (i.e. you choose i and j and replace a_i with a_j).Your task is to say if it is possible to obtain an array with an odd (not divisible by 2) sum of elements.You have to answer t independent test cases.
294	Food Buying Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some  1 \le x \le s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain \lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains \lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor back). The operation \lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor means a divided by b rounded down.It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.You have to answer t independent test cases.
295	Yet Another Walking Robot There is a robot on a coordinate plane. Initially, the robot is located at the point (0, 0). Its path is described as a string s of length n consisting of characters '', '', '', ''.Each of these characters corresponds to some move: The company that created this robot asked you to optimize the path of the robot somehow. To do this, you can remove  of the path. But this company doesn't want their customers to notice the change in the robot behavior. It means that if before the optimization the robot ended its path at the point (x_e, y_e), then after optimization (i.e. removing some single substring from s) the robot also ends its path at the point (x_e, y_e).This optimization is a low-budget project so you need to remove  possible  substring to optimize the robot's path such that the endpoint of his path doesn't change. It is possible that you can't optimize the path. Also, it is possible that after the optimization the target path is an empty string (i.e. deleted substring is the whole string s).Recall that the substring of s is such string that can be obtained from s by removing some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the prefix and some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the suffix. For example, the substrings of "" are "", "", "", "", but not "" and "".You have to answer t independent test cases.
296	Fight with Monsters There are n monsters standing in a row numbered from 1 to n. The i-th monster has h_i health points (hp). You have your attack power equal to a hp and your opponent has his attack power equal to b hp.You and your opponent are fighting these monsters. Firstly, you and your opponent go to the first monster and fight it till his death, then you and your opponent go the second monster and fight it till his death, and so on. A monster is considered dead if its hp is less than or equal to 0.The fight with a monster happens in turns. You have some secret technique to force your opponent to skip his turn. You can use this technique at most k times  (for example, if there are two monsters and k=4, then you can use the technique 2 times on the first monster and 1 time on the second monster, but not 2 times on the first monster and 3 times on the second monster).Your task is to determine the maximum number of points you can gain if you use the secret technique optimally.
297	Berland Beauty There are n railway stations in Berland. They are connected to each other by n-1 railway sections. The railway network is connected, i.e. can be represented as an undirected tree.You have a map of that network, so for each railway section you know which stations it connects.Each of the n-1 sections has some integer value of the . However, these values are not marked on the map and you don't know them. All these values are from 1 to 10^6 inclusive.You asked m passengers some questions: the j-th one told you three values:You are planning to update the map and set some value f_i on each railway section — the . The passengers' answers should be consistent with these values.Print any valid set of values f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{n-1}, which the passengers' answer is consistent with or report that it doesn't exist.
298	Anu Has a Function Anu has created her own function f: f(x, y) = (x | y) - y where | denotes the . For example, f(11, 6) = (11|6) - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9. It can be proved that for any nonnegative numbers x and y value of f(x, y) is also nonnegative. She would like to research more about this function and has created multiple problems for herself. But she isn't able to solve all of them and needs your help. Here is one of these problems.A value of an array [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] is defined as f(f(\dots f(f(a_1, a_2), a_3), \dots a_{n-1}), a_n) (see notes). You are given an array with  elements. How should you reorder its elements so that the value of the array is maximal possible?
299	Aerodynamic  You're given a  (i. e. no three points are collinear) polygon P which is defined by coordinates of its vertices. Define P(x,y) as a polygon obtained by translating P by vector \overrightarrow {(x,y)}. The picture below depicts an example of the translation:Define T as a set of points which is the union of all P(x,y) such that the origin (0,0) lies in P(x,y) (both strictly inside and on the boundary). There is also an equivalent definition: a point (x,y) lies in T only if there are two points A,B in P such that \overrightarrow {AB} = \overrightarrow {(x,y)}. One can prove T is a polygon too. For example, if P is a regular triangle then T is a regular hexagon. At the picture below P is drawn in black and some P(x,y) which contain the origin are drawn in colored:  Your task is to check whether the polygons P and T are .
300	Water Balance There are n water tanks in a row, i-th of them contains a_i liters of water. The tanks are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.You can perform the following operation: choose some subsegment [l, r] (1\le l \le r \le n), and redistribute water in tanks l, l+1, \dots, r evenly. In other words, replace each of a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r by \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1}. For example, if for volumes [1, 3, 6, 7] you choose l = 2, r = 3, new volumes of water will be [1, 4.5, 4.5, 7]. .What is the lexicographically smallest sequence of volumes of water that you can achieve?As a reminder:A sequence a is lexicographically smaller than a sequence b of the same length if and only if the following holds: in the first (leftmost) position where a and b differ, the sequence a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.
301	Around the World You are given a simple weighted undirected connected graph with n vertexes and m edges with the following restriction: there isn't any simple cycle (i. e. a cycle which doesn't pass through any vertex more than once) of length greater than 3 which passes through the vertex 1. The cost of a path (not necessarily simple) in this graph is defined as the  of weights of all edges in that path with each edge being counted as many times as the path passes through it. You may choose any subset of edges incident to the vertex 1 and remove them. How many are there such subsets, that, when removed, there is not any nontrivial cycle with the cost equal to 0 which passes through the vertex 1 in the resulting graph? A cycle is called  if it passes through some edge odd number of times. As the answer can be very big, output it modulo 10^9+7.
302	So Mean .We have hidden a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n of numbers from 1 to n from you, where n . You can try to guess it using the following queries:? k a_1 a_2 \dots a_k.In response, you will learn if the average of elements with indexes a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k is an integer. In other words, you will receive 1 if \frac{p_{a_1} + p_{a_2} + \dots + p_{a_k}}{k} is integer, and 0 otherwise. You have to guess the permutation. You can ask .Note that permutations [p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k] and [n + 1 - p_1, n + 1 - p_2, \dots, n + 1 - p_k] are indistinguishable. Therefore, .Note that the permutation p is fixed before the start of the interaction and doesn't depend on your queries. In other words, .Note that you don't have to minimize the number of queries.
303	Non-zero Guy-Manuel and Thomas have an array a of n integers [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]. In one step they can add 1 to any element of the array. Formally, in one step they can choose any integer index i (1 \le i \le n) and do a_i := a_i + 1.What is the minimum number of steps they need to do to make both the sum and the product of all elements in the array ? Formally, find the minimum number of steps to make a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n \ne 0 and a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots \cdot a_n \ne 0.
304	Assigning to Classes  of the array [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2k+1}] of odd number of elements is defined as follows: let [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{2k+1}] be the elements of the array in the sorted order. Then median of this array is equal to b_{k+1}.There are 2n students, the i-th student has skill level a_i. It's  that all skill levels are distinct.Let's define  as the median of skill levels of students of the class.As a principal of the school, you would like to assign each student to one of the 2 classes such that each class has  (not divisible by 2). The number of students in the classes may be equal or different, by your choice. Every student has to be assigned to exactly one class. Among such partitions, you want to choose one in which the absolute difference between skill levels of the classes is minimized.What is the minimum possible absolute difference you can achieve?
305	Three Strings You are given three strings a, b and c of the same length n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The i-th letter of a is a_i, the i-th letter of b is b_i, the i-th letter of c is c_i.For every i (1 \leq i \leq n) you  swap (i.e. exchange) c_i with either a_i or b_i. So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i \leftrightarrow a_i or c_i \leftrightarrow b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).For example, if a is "", b is "", and c is "", you can make c equal to "" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes "" and b becomes "".Is it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?
306	Motarack's Birthday Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array a of n non-negative integers.Dark created that array 1000 years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer k (0 \leq k \leq 10^{9}) and replaces all missing elements in the array a with k.Let m be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of |a_i - a_{i+1}| for all 1 \leq i \leq n - 1) in the array a after Dark replaces all missing elements with k.Dark should choose an integer k so that m is minimized. Can you help him?
307	Ayoub's function Ayoub thinks that he is a very smart person, so he created a function f(s), where s is a binary string (a string which contains only symbols "" and ""). The function f(s) is equal to the number of substrings in the string s that contains at least one symbol, that is equal to "".More formally, f(s) is equal to the number of pairs of integers (l, r), such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s| (where |s| is equal to the length of string s), such that at least one of the symbols s_l, s_{l+1}, \ldots, s_r is equal to "". For example, if s = "" then f(s) = 12, because there are 12 such pairs (l, r): (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5).Ayoub also thinks that he is smarter than Mahmoud so he gave him two integers n and m and asked him this problem. For all binary strings s of length n which contains exactly m symbols equal to "", find the maximum value of f(s).Mahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him? 
308	Time to Run Bashar was practicing for the national programming contest. Because of sitting too much in front of the computer without doing physical movements and eating a lot Bashar became much fatter. Bashar is going to quit programming after the national contest and he is going to become an actor (just like his father), so he should lose weight.In order to lose weight, Bashar is going to run for k kilometers. Bashar is going to run in a place that looks like a grid of n rows and m columns. In this grid there are two one-way roads of one-kilometer length between each pair of adjacent by side cells, one road is going from the first cell to the second one, and the other road is going from the second cell to the first one. So, there are exactly (4 n m - 2n - 2m) roads.Let's take, for example, n = 3 and m = 4. In this case, there are 34 roads. It is the picture of this case (arrows describe roads):Bashar wants to run by these rules:Bashar asks you if it is possible to run by such rules. If it is possible, you should tell him how should he run.You should give him a steps to do and since Bashar can't remember too many steps, a should not exceed 3000. In every step, you should give him an integer f and a string of moves s of length at most 4 which means that he should repeat the moves in the string s for f times. He will perform the steps in the order you print them.For example, if the steps are 2 , 3  then the moves he is going to move are  +  +  +  +  = .Can you help him and give him a correct sequence of moves such that the total distance he will run is equal to k kilometers or say, that it is impossible?
309	Nanosoft Warawreh created a great company called Nanosoft. The only thing that Warawreh still has to do is to place a large picture containing its logo on top of the company's building.The logo of Nanosoft can be described as four squares of the same size merged together into one large square. The top left square is colored with red, the top right square is colored with green, the bottom left square is colored with yellow and the bottom right square is colored with blue.An Example of some correct logos:An Example of some incorrect logos:Warawreh went to Adhami's store in order to buy the needed picture. Although Adhami's store is very large he has only one picture that can be described as a grid of n rows and m columns. The color of every cell in the picture will be green (the symbol ''), red (the symbol ''), yellow (the symbol '') or blue (the symbol '').Adhami gave Warawreh q options, in every option he gave him a sub-rectangle from that picture and told him that he can cut that sub-rectangle for him. To choose the best option, Warawreh needs to know for every option the maximum area of sub-square inside the given sub-rectangle that can be a Nanosoft logo. If there are no such sub-squares, the answer is 0.Warawreh couldn't find the best option himself so he asked you for help, can you help him?
310	Super Jaber Jaber is a superhero in a large country that can be described as a grid with n rows and m columns, where every cell in that grid contains a different city.Jaber gave every city in that country a specific color between 1 and k. In one second he can go from the current city to any of the cities adjacent by the side or to any city with the same color as the current city color.Jaber has to do q missions. In every mission he will be in the city at row r_1 and column c_1, and he should help someone in the city at row r_2 and column c_2.Jaber wants your help to tell him the minimum possible time to go from the starting city to the finishing city for every mission.
311	Erasing Zeroes You are given a string s. Each character is either  or .You want all 's in the string to form a contiguous subsegment. For example, if the string is , ,  or , then all 's form a contiguous subsegment, and if the string is ,  or , then this condition is not met.You may erase some (possibly none) 's from the string. What is the minimum number of 's that you have to erase?
312	National Project Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length n. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing.Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are g days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next b days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again g good days, b bad days and so on.You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days 1, 2, \dots, g are good.You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that  will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the n = 5 then at least 3 units of the highway should have high quality; if n = 4 then at least 2 units should have high quality.What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of ?
313	Perfect Keyboard Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are too complicated for him — his keyboard will consist of only one row, where all 26 lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.Polycarp uses the same password s on all websites where he is registered (it is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in s, they should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is , then the layout  is perfect, since characters  and  are adjacent on the keyboard, and  and  are adjacent on the keyboard. It is guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in s, so, for example, the password cannot be  (two characters  are adjacent).Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it is possible?
314	Fill The Bag You have a bag of size n. Also you have m boxes. The size of i-th box is a_i, where each a_i is an integer non-negative power of two.You can divide boxes into two parts of equal size. Your goal is to fill the bag completely.For example, if n = 10 and a = [1, 1, 32] then you have to divide the box of size 32 into two parts of size 16, and then divide the box of size 16. So you can fill the bag with boxes of size 1, 1 and 8.Calculate the minimum number of divisions required to fill the bag of size n.
315	Erase Subsequences You are given a string s. You can build new string p from s using the following operation : Of course, initially the string p is empty. For example, let s = \text{ababcd}. At first, let's choose subsequence s_1 s_4 s_5 = \text{abc} — we will get s = \text{bad} and p = \text{abc}. At second, let's choose s_1 s_2 = \text{ba} — we will get s = \text{d} and p = \text{abcba}. So we can build \text{abcba} from \text{ababcd}.Can you build a given string t using the algorithm above?
316	Number of Components You are given a matrix n \times m, initially filled with zeroes. We define a_{i, j} as the element in the i-th row and the j-th column of the matrix.Two cells of the matrix are  if they share a side, and the elements in these cells are equal. Two cells of the matrix belong to the same  if there exists a sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_k such that s_1 is the first cell, s_k is the second cell, and for every i \in [1, k - 1], s_i and s_{i + 1} are connected.You are given q queries of the form x_i y_i c_i (i \in [1, q]). For every such query, you have to do the following:There is one additional constraint: for every i \in [1, q - 1], c_i \le c_{i + 1}.
317	Two Rabbits Being tired of participating in too many Codeforces rounds, Gildong decided to take some rest in a park. He sat down on a bench, and soon he found two rabbits hopping around. One of the rabbits was taller than the other.He noticed that the two rabbits were hopping . The positions of the two rabbits can be represented as integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The taller rabbit is currently on position x, and the shorter rabbit is currently on position y (x \lt y). Every second, each rabbit hops to another position. The taller rabbit hops to the positive direction by a, and the shorter rabbit hops to the negative direction by b.For example, let's say x=0, y=10, a=2, and b=3. At the 1-st second, each rabbit will be at position 2 and 7. At the 2-nd second, both rabbits will be at position 4.Gildong is now wondering:  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the rabbits will be at the same point.
318	Longest Palindrome Returning back to problem solving, Gildong is now studying about palindromes. He learned that a  is a string that is the same as its reverse. For example, strings "", "", "", and "" are palindromes, while strings "", "", and "" are not. Gildong loves this concept so much, so he wants to play with it. He has n  strings of equal length m. He wants to discard some of the strings (possibly none or all) and reorder the remaining strings so that the concatenation becomes a palindrome. He also wants the palindrome to be as long as possible. Please help him find one.
319	Air Conditioner Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: , , and . When it's , the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's , the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's , the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is  initially.Each customer is characterized by three values: t_i — the time (in minutes) when the i-th customer visits the restaurant, l_i — the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and h_i — the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the i-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between l_i and h_i (inclusive) in the t_i-th minute.Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.
320	Shortest and Longest LIS Gildong recently learned how to find the  (LIS) in O(n\log{n}) time for a sequence of length n. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, to test his code with your output.The quiz is as follows.Gildong provides a string of length n-1, consisting of characters '' and '' only. The i-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the i-th element and the i+1-st element of the sequence. If the i-th character of the string is '', then the i-th element of the sequence is less than the i+1-st element. If the i-th character of the string is '', then the i-th element of the sequence is greater than the i+1-st element.He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.
321	1-Trees and Queries Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called . Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. . All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.
322	Kuroni and the Gifts Kuroni has n daughters. As gifts for them, he bought n necklaces and n bracelets:Kuroni wants to give  necklace and  bracelet to each of his daughters. To make sure that all of them look unique, the total brightnesses of the gifts given to each daughter should be . Formally, if the i-th daughter receives a necklace with brightness x_i and a bracelet with brightness y_i, then the sums x_i + y_i should be pairwise distinct. Help Kuroni to distribute the gifts.For example, if the brightnesses are a = [1, 7, 5] and b = [6, 1, 2], then we may distribute the gifts as follows:Here is an example of an  distribution: This distribution is , as the total brightnesses of the gifts received by the first and the third daughter are the same. Don't make them this upset!
323	Kuroni and Simple Strings We say that a string formed by n characters  or  is  if its length n is even and positive, its first \frac{n}{2} characters are , and its last \frac{n}{2} characters are . For example, the strings  and  are simple, while the strings  and  are not simple.Kuroni will be given a string formed by characters  and  (the given string is not necessarily simple). An operation consists of choosing a subsequence of the characters of the string that forms a simple string and removing all the characters of this subsequence from the string. . For example, he can apply the operation to the string , to choose a subsequence of bold characters, as it forms a simple string , delete these bold characters from the string and to get . Kuroni has to perform the minimum possible number of operations on the string, in such a way that no more operations can be performed on the remaining string. The resulting string  have to be empty.Since the given string is too large, Kuroni is unable to figure out how to minimize the number of operations. Can you help him do it instead?A sequence of characters a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
324	Kuroni and Impossible Calculation To become the king of Codeforces, Kuroni has to solve the following problem.He is given n numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Help Kuroni to calculate \prod_{1\le i<j\le n} |a_i - a_j|. As result can be very big, output it modulo m.If you are not familiar with short notation, \prod_{1\le i<j\le n} |a_i - a_j| is equal to |a_1 - a_2|\cdot|a_1 - a_3|\cdot \dots \cdot|a_1 - a_n|\cdot|a_2 - a_3|\cdot|a_2 - a_4|\cdot \dots \cdot|a_2 - a_n| \cdot \dots \cdot |a_{n-1} - a_n|. In other words, this is the product of |a_i - a_j| for all 1\le i < j \le n.
325	Kuroni and the Celebration After getting AC after 13 Time Limit Exceeded verdicts on a geometry problem, Kuroni went to an Italian restaurant to celebrate this holy achievement. Unfortunately, the excess sauce disoriented him, and he's now lost!The United States of America can be modeled as a tree (why though) with n vertices. The tree is rooted at vertex r, wherein lies Kuroni's hotel.Kuroni has a phone app designed to help him in such emergency cases. To use the app, he has to input two vertices u and v, and it'll return a vertex w, which is the lowest common ancestor of those two vertices.However, since the phone's battery has been almost drained out from live-streaming Kuroni's celebration party, he could only use the app at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor times. After that, the phone would die and there will be nothing left to help our dear friend! :(As the night is cold and dark, Kuroni needs to get back, so that he can reunite with his comfy bed and pillow(s). Can you help him figure out his hotel's location?
326	Kuroni and the Score Distribution Kuroni is the coordinator of the next Mathforces round written by the "Proof by AC" team. All the preparation has been done, and he is discussing with the team about the score distribution for the round.The round consists of n problems, numbered from 1 to n. The problems are ordered in increasing order of difficulty, no two problems have the same difficulty. A score distribution for the round can be denoted by an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where a_i is the score of i-th problem. Kuroni thinks that the score distribution should satisfy the following requirements:Help the team find a score distribution that satisfies Kuroni's requirement. In case such a score distribution does not exist, output -1.
327	Kuroni and the Punishment Kuroni is very angry at the other setters for using him as a theme! As a punishment, he forced them to solve the following problem:You have an array a consisting of n positive integers. An operation consists of choosing an element and either adding 1 to it or subtracting 1 from it, such that the element remains positive. We say the array is  if the greatest common divisor of all its elements is not 1. Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array good.Unable to match Kuroni's intellect, the setters failed to solve the problem. Help them escape from Kuroni's punishment!
328	Cow and Haybales The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange  of n haybale piles on the farm. The i-th pile contains a_i haybales. However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n) such that |i-j|=1 and a_i>0 and apply a_i = a_i - 1, a_j = a_j + 1. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy.Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile 1 (i.e. to maximize a_1), and she only has d days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile 1 if she acts optimally!
329	Cow and Friend Bessie has way too many friends because she is everyone's favorite cow! Her new friend Rabbit is trying to hop over so they can play! More specifically, he wants to get from (0,0) to (x,0) by making multiple hops. He is only willing to hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its n favorite numbers: a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. What is the minimum number of hops Rabbit needs to get from (0,0) to (x,0)? Rabbit may land on points with non-integer coordinates. It can be proved that Rabbit can always reach his destination.Recall that the Euclidean distance between points (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) is \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}.For example, if Rabbit has favorite numbers 1 and 3 he could hop from (0,0) to (4,0) in two hops as shown below. Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to (4,0) in 2 hops (e.g. (0,0) \rightarrow (2,-\sqrt{5}) \rightarrow (4,0)).In other words, each time Rabbit chooses some number a_i and hops with distance equal to a_i in any direction he wants. The same number can be used multiple times.
330	Cow and Message Bessie the cow has just intercepted a text that Farmer John sent to Burger Queen! However, Bessie is sure that there is a secret message hidden inside.The text is a string s of lowercase Latin letters. She considers a string t as hidden in string s if t exists as a subsequence of s whose indices form an arithmetic progression. For example, the string  is hidden in string  because it occurs at indices 1, 3, and 5, which form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. Bessie thinks that any hidden string that occurs the most times is the secret message. Two occurrences of a subsequence of S are distinct if the sets of indices are different. Help her find the number of occurrences of the secret message!For example, in the string ,  is hidden 3 times,  is hidden 2 times,  is hidden 6 times,  is hidden 3 times,  is hidden 1 time,  is hidden 2 times,  is hidden 1 time,  is hidden 1 time,  is hidden 1 time,  is hidden 1 time, and  is hidden 1 time. The number of occurrences of the secret message is 6.
331	Cow and Fields Bessie is out grazing on the farm, which consists of n fields connected by m bidirectional roads. She is currently at field 1, and will return to her home at field n at the end of the day.The Cowfederation of Barns has ordered Farmer John to install one extra bidirectional road. The farm has k special fields and he has decided to install the road between two different special fields. He may add the road between two special fields that already had a road directly connecting them.After the road is added, Bessie will return home on the shortest path from field 1 to field n. Since Bessie needs more exercise, Farmer John must  the length of this shortest path. Help him!
332	Cow and Treats After a successful year of milk production, Farmer John is rewarding his cows with their favorite treat: tasty grass!On the field, there is a row of n units of grass, each with a sweetness s_i. Farmer John has m cows, each with a favorite sweetness f_i and a hunger value h_i. He would like to pick two disjoint subsets of cows to line up on the left and right side of the grass row. There is no restriction on how many cows must be on either side. The cows will be treated in the following manner: Note that grass does not grow back. Also, to prevent cows from getting upset, not every cow has to feed since FJ can choose a subset of them. Surprisingly, FJ has determined that sleeping cows are the most satisfied. If FJ orders optimally, what is the maximum number of sleeping cows that can result, and how many ways can FJ choose the subset of cows on the left and right side to achieve that maximum number of sleeping cows (modulo 10^9+7)? The order in which FJ sends the cows does not matter as long as no cows get upset. 
333	Cow and Vacation Bessie is planning a vacation! In Cow-lifornia, there are n cities, with n-1 bidirectional roads connecting them. It is guaranteed that one can reach any city from any other city. Bessie is considering v possible vacation plans, with the i-th one consisting of a start city a_i and destination city b_i.It is known that only r of the cities have rest stops. Bessie gets tired easily, and cannot travel across more than k consecutive roads without resting. In fact, she is so desperate to rest that she may travel through the same city multiple times in order to do so.For each of the vacation plans, does there exist a way for Bessie to travel from the starting city to the destination city?
334	Recommendations VK news recommendation system daily selects interesting publications of one of n disjoint categories for each user. Each publication belongs to exactly one category. For each category i batch algorithm selects a_i publications.The latest A/B test suggests that users are reading recommended publications more actively if each category has a different number of publications within daily recommendations. The targeted algorithm can find a single interesting publication of i-th category within t_i seconds. What is the minimum total time necessary to add publications to the result of batch algorithm execution, so all categories have a different number of publications? You can't remove publications recommended by the batch algorithm.
335	Double Elimination The biggest event of the year – Cota 2 world championship "The Innernational" is right around the corner. 2^n teams will compete in a double-elimination format (please, carefully read problem statement even if you know what is it) to identify the champion. Teams are numbered from 1 to 2^n and will play games one-on-one. All teams start in the upper bracket.All upper bracket matches will be held played between teams that haven't lost any games yet. Teams are split into games by team numbers. Game winner advances in the next round of upper bracket, losers drop into the lower bracket.Lower bracket starts with 2^{n-1} teams that lost the first upper bracket game. Each lower bracket round consists of two games. In the first game of a round 2^k teams play a game with each other (teams are split into games by team numbers). 2^{k-1} loosing teams are eliminated from the championship, 2^{k-1} winning teams are playing 2^{k-1} teams that got eliminated in this round of upper bracket (again, teams are split into games by team numbers). As a result of each round both upper and lower bracket have 2^{k-1} teams remaining. See example notes for better understanding.Single remaining team of upper bracket plays with single remaining team of lower bracket in grand-finals to identify championship winner.You are a fan of teams with numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k. You want the championship to have as many games with your favourite teams as possible. Luckily, you can affect results of every championship game the way you want. What's maximal possible number of championship games that include teams you're fan of?
336	Au Pont Rouge VK just opened its second HQ in St. Petersburg! Side of its office building has a huge string s written on its side. This part of the office is supposed to be split into m meeting rooms in such way that meeting room walls are strictly between letters on the building. Obviously, meeting rooms should not be of size 0, but can be as small as one letter wide. Each meeting room will be named after the substring of s written on its side.For each possible arrangement of m meeting rooms we ordered a test meeting room label for the meeting room with lexicographically  name. When delivered, those labels got sorted  lexicographically.What is printed on kth label of the delivery?
337	Tourism Masha lives in a country with n cities numbered from 1 to n. She lives in the city number 1. There is a direct train  between each pair of distinct cities i and j, where i \neq j. In total there are n(n-1) distinct routes. Every route has a cost, cost for route from i to j may be different from the cost of route from j to i.Masha wants to start her journey in city 1, take  k routes from one city to another and as a result return to the city 1. Masha is really careful with money, so she wants the journey to be as cheap as possible. To do so Masha doesn't mind visiting a city multiple times or even taking the same route multiple times.Masha doesn't want her journey to have odd cycles. Formally, if you can select visited by Masha city v, take  number of routes used by Masha in her journey and return to the city v, such journey is considered unsuccessful.Help Masha to find the cheapest (with minimal total cost of all taken routes) successful journey.
338	Strange Function Let's define the function f of multiset a as the multiset of number of occurences of every number, that is present in a.E.g., f(\{5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 5\}) = \{1, 1, 2, 2, 4\}.Let's define f^k(a), as applying f to array a k times: f^k(a) = f(f^{k-1}(a)), f^0(a) = a. E.g., f^2(\{5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 5\}) = \{1, 2, 2\}.You are given integers n, k and you are asked how many different values the function f^k(a) can have, where a is arbitrary non-empty array with numbers of size no more than n. Print the answer modulo 998\,244\,353.
339	Bad Cryptography In modern cryptography much is tied to the algorithmic complexity of solving several problems. One of such problems is a discrete logarithm problem. It is formulated as follows: It is most likely that modern mankind cannot solve the problem of discrete logarithm for a sufficiently large field size. For example, for a field of residues modulo prime number, primes of 1024 or 2048 bits are considered to be safe. However, calculations with such large numbers can place a significant load on servers that perform cryptographic operations. For this reason, instead of a simple module residue field, more complex fields are often used. For such field no fast algorithms that use a field structure are known, smaller fields can be used and operations can be properly optimized. Developer Nikolai does not trust the generally accepted methods, so he wants to invent his own. Recently, he read about a very strange field — , and thinks it's a great fit for the purpose. The field of nimbers is defined on a set of integers from 0 to 2^{2^k} - 1 for some positive integer k . Bitwise exclusive or (\oplus) operation is used as addition. One of ways to define multiplication operation (\odot) is following properties: For example: Formally, this algorithm can be described by following pseudo-code. It can be shown, that this operations really forms a field. Moreover, than can make sense as game theory operations, but that's not related to problem much. With the help of appropriate caching and grouping of operations, it is possible to calculate the product quickly enough, which is important to improve speed of the cryptoalgorithm. More formal definitions as well as additional properties can be clarified in the wikipedia article at . The authors of the task hope that the properties listed in the statement should be enough for the solution. Powering for such muliplication is defined in same way, formally a^{\odot k} = \underbrace{a \odot a \odot \cdots \odot a}_{k~\texttt{times}}.You need to analyze the proposed scheme strength. For pairs of numbers a and b you need to find such x, that a^{\odot x} = b, or determine that it doesn't exist. 
340	Add Odd or Subtract Even You are given two positive integers a and b.In one move, you can  a in the following way:You can perform as many such operations as you want. You can choose the same numbers x and y in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a. It is guaranteed that you can always obtain b from a.You have to answer t independent test cases.
341	WeirdSort You are given an array a of length n.You are also given a set of  positions p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m, where 1 \le p_i < n. The position p_i means that you can swap elements a[p_i] and a[p_i + 1]. You can apply this operation any number of times for each of the given .Your task is to determine if it is possible to sort the initial array in non-decreasing order (a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n) using only allowed swaps.For example, if a = [3, 2, 1] and p = [1, 2], then we can first swap elements a[2] and a[3] (because position 2 is contained in the given set p). We get the array a = [3, 1, 2]. Then we swap a[1] and a[2] (position 1 is also contained in p). We get the array a = [1, 3, 2]. Finally, we swap a[2] and a[3] again and get the array a = [1, 2, 3], sorted in non-decreasing order.You can see that if a = [4, 1, 2, 3] and p = [3, 2] then you cannot sort the array.You have to answer t independent test cases.
342	Perform the Combo You want to perform the combo on your opponent in one popular fighting game. The combo is the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. To perform the combo, you have to press all buttons in the order they appear in s. I.e. if s="" then you have to press '', then '', '' and '' again.You know that you will spend m wrong tries to perform the combo and during the i-th try you will make a mistake right after p_i-th button (1 \le p_i < n) (i.e. you will press first p_i buttons right and start performing the combo from the beginning). It is guaranteed that during the m+1-th try you press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.I.e. if s="", m=2 and p = [1, 3] then the sequence of pressed buttons will be '' ( you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), '', '', '', ( you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), '' (), '', '', ''.Your task is to calculate for each button (letter) the number of times you'll press it.You have to answer t independent test cases.
343	Three Integers You are given three integers a \le b \le c.In one move, you can add +1 or -1 to  of these integers (i.e. increase or decrease any number by one). You can perform such operation any (possibly, zero) number of times, you can even perform this operation several times with one number. .You have to perform the minimum number of such operations in order to obtain three integers A \le B \le C such that B is divisible by A and C is divisible by B.You have to answer t independent test cases. 
344	Construct the Binary Tree You are given two integers n and d. You need to construct a rooted binary tree consisting of n vertices with a root at the vertex 1 and the sum of depths of all vertices equals to d.A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. A parent of a vertex v is the last different from v vertex on the path from the root to the vertex v. The depth of the vertex v is the length of the path from the root to the vertex v. Children of vertex v are all vertices for which v is the parent. The binary tree is such a tree that no vertex has more than 2 children.You have to answer t independent test cases.
345	Moving Points There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t ) is calculated as x_i + t \cdot v_i.Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even ). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.Your task is to calculate the value \sum\limits_{1 \le i < j \le n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).
346	Two Regular Polygons You are given two integers n and m (m < n). Consider a  regular polygon of n vertices. Recall that a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length).Your task is to say if it is possible to build another  regular polygon with m vertices such that its center coincides with the center of the initial polygon and each of its vertices is some vertex of the initial polygon.You have to answer t independent test cases.
347	Bogosort You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n. Array is good if for each pair of indexes i < j the condition j - a_j \ne i - a_i holds. Can you shuffle this array so that it becomes good? To shuffle an array means to reorder its elements arbitrarily (leaving the initial order is also an option).For example, if a = [1, 1, 3, 5], then shuffled arrays [1, 3, 5, 1], [3, 5, 1, 1] and [5, 3, 1, 1] are good, but shuffled arrays [3, 1, 5, 1], [1, 1, 3, 5] and [1, 1, 5, 3] aren't.It's guaranteed that it's always possible to shuffle an array to meet this condition.
348	Adding Powers Suppose you are performing the following algorithm. There is an array v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n filled with zeroes at start. The following operation is applied to the array several times — at i-th step (0-indexed) you can: You can choose how the algorithm would behave on each step and when to stop it. The question is: can you make array v equal to the given array a (v_j = a_j for each j) after some step?
349	Count the Arrays Your task is to calculate the number of arrays such that:
350	Array Shrinking You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. You can perform the following operation any number of times:After each such operation, the length of the array will decrease by one (and elements are renumerated accordingly). What is the minimum possible length of the array a you can get?
351	Attack on Red Kingdom The Red Kingdom is attacked by the White King and the Black King!The Kingdom is guarded by n castles, the i-th castle is defended by a_i soldiers. To conquer the Red Kingdom, the Kings have to eliminate all the defenders. Each day the White King launches an attack on one of the castles. Then, at night, the forces of the Black King attack a castle (possibly the same one). Then the White King attacks a castle, then the Black King, and so on. The first attack is performed by the White King.Each attack must target a castle with  alive defender in it. There are three types of attacks:The  can be launched at any valid target (at any castle with at least one soldier). However, the  cannot be launched if the  had the same type, no matter when and by whom it was launched. The same applies to the . A castle that was not attacked at all can be targeted by any type of attack.The King who launches the last attack will be glorified as the conqueror of the Red Kingdom, so both Kings want to launch the last attack (and they are wise enough to find a strategy that allows them to do it no matter what are the actions of their opponent, if such strategy exists). The White King is leading his first attack, and you are responsible for planning it. Can you calculate the number of possible options for the first attack that allow the White King to launch the last attack? Each option for the first attack is represented by the targeted castle and the type of attack, and two options are different if the targeted castles or the types of attack are different.
352	Fast Food Restaurant Tired of boring office work, Denis decided to open a fast food restaurant.On the first day he made a portions of dumplings, b portions of cranberry juice and c pancakes with condensed milk.The peculiarity of Denis's restaurant is the procedure of ordering food. For each visitor Denis himself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so, Denis is guided by the following rules:What is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed?
353	Different Rules Nikolay has only recently started in competitive programming, but already qualified to the finals of one prestigious olympiad. There going to be n participants, one of whom is Nikolay. Like any good olympiad, it consists of two rounds. Tired of the traditional rules, in which the participant who solved the largest number of problems wins, the organizers came up with different rules.Suppose in the first round participant A took x-th place and in the second round — y-th place. Then the total score of the participant A is sum x + y. The overall place of the participant A is the number of participants (including A) having their total score less than or equal to the total score of A. Note, that some participants may end up having a common overall place. It is also important to note, that in both the first and the second round there were no two participants tying at a common place. In other words, for every i from 1 to n  participant took i-th place in first round and  participant took i-th place in second round.Right after the end of the Olympiad, Nikolay was informed that he got x-th place in first round and y-th place in the second round. Nikolay doesn't know the results of other participants, yet he wonders what is the minimum and maximum place he can take, if we consider the most favorable and unfavorable outcome for him. Please help Nikolay to find the answer to this question.
354	Happy New Year Being Santa Claus is very difficult. Sometimes you have to deal with difficult situations.Today Santa Claus came to the holiday and there were m children lined up in front of him. Let's number them from 1 to m. Grandfather Frost knows n spells. The i-th spell gives a candy to every child whose place is in the [L_i, R_i] range. Each spell can be used at most once. It is also known that if all spells are used, each child will receive at most k candies.It is not good for children to eat a lot of sweets, so each child can eat no more than one candy, while the remaining candies will be equally divided between his (or her) Mom and Dad. So it turns out that if a child would be given an even amount of candies (possibly zero), then he (or she) will be unable to eat any candies and will go sad. However, the rest of the children (who received an odd number of candies) will be happy.Help Santa Claus to know the maximum number of children he can make happy by casting some of his spells.
355	Concatenation with intersection Vasya had three strings a, b and s, which consist of lowercase English letters. The lengths of strings a and b are equal to n, the length of the string s is equal to m. Vasya decided to choose a substring of the string a, then choose a substring of the string b and concatenate them. Formally, he chooses a segment [l_1, r_1] (1 \leq l_1 \leq r_1 \leq n) and a segment [l_2, r_2] (1 \leq l_2 \leq r_2 \leq n), and after concatenation he obtains a string a[l_1, r_1] + b[l_2, r_2] = a_{l_1} a_{l_1 + 1} \ldots a_{r_1} b_{l_2} b_{l_2 + 1} \ldots b_{r_2}.Now, Vasya is interested in counting number of ways to choose those segments adhering to the following conditions:
356	Dead Pixel Screen resolution of Polycarp's monitor is a \times b pixels. Unfortunately, there is one dead pixel at his screen. It has coordinates (x, y) (0 \le x < a, 0 \le y < b). You can consider columns of pixels to be numbered from 0 to a-1, and rows — from 0 to b-1.Polycarp wants to open a rectangular window of maximal size, which doesn't contain the dead pixel. The boundaries of the window should be parallel to the sides of the screen.Print the maximal area (in pixels) of a window that doesn't contain the dead pixel inside itself.
357	Homecoming After a long party Petya decided to return home, but he turned out to be at the opposite end of the town from his home. There are n crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.The crossroads are represented as a string s of length n, where s_i = \texttt{A}, if there is a bus station at i-th crossroad, and s_i = \texttt{B}, if there is a tram station at i-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to s_1) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to s_n).If for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, \ldots, j-1 there is a bus station, one can pay a roubles for the bus ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying a roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = \texttt{A} for all i \le t < j. If for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, \ldots, j-1 there is a tram station, one can pay b roubles for the tram ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying b roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = \texttt{B} for all i \le t < j.For example, if s="", a=4 and b=3 then Petya needs:Thus, in total he needs to spend 4+3+4=11 roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character s_n) does not affect the final expense.Now Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the n-th crossroad. After the party he has left with p roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.Help him to choose the closest crossroad i to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the i-th crossroad to the n-th, using only tram and bus tickets.
358	Restoring Permutation You are given a sequence b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n. Find the lexicographically minimal permutation a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} such that b_i = \min(a_{2i-1}, a_{2i}), or determine that it is impossible.
359	Grade Allocation n students are taking an exam. The highest possible score at this exam is m. Let a_{i} be the score of the i-th student. You have access to the school database which stores the results of all students.You can change each student's score as long as the following conditions are satisfied: You are student 1 and you would like to maximize your own score.Find the highest possible score you can assign to yourself such that all conditions are satisfied.
360	String Modification Vasya has a string s of length n. He decides to make the following modification to the string: Vasya wants to choose a k such that the string obtained after the above-mentioned modification is lexicographically smallest possible among all choices of k. Among all such k, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity 2020, he asks for your help.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: 
361	Primitive Primes It is Professor R's last class of his teaching career. Every time Professor R taught a class, he gave a special problem for the students to solve. You being his favourite student, put your heart into solving it one last time.You are given two polynomials f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} and g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \dots + b_{m-1}x^{m-1}, with positive integral coefficients. It is guaranteed that the cumulative GCD of the coefficients is equal to 1 for both the given polynomials. In other words, gcd(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}) = gcd(b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{m-1}) = 1. Let h(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x). Suppose that h(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \dots + c_{n+m-2}x^{n+m-2}. You are also given a prime number p. Professor R challenges you to find any t such that c_t isn't divisible by p. He guarantees you that under these conditions such t always exists. If there are several such t, output any of them.
362	Nash Matrix Nash designed an interesting yet simple board game where a player is simply required to follow instructions written on the cell where the player currently stands. This board game is played on the n\times n board. Rows and columns of this board are numbered from 1 to n. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and c-th column is denoted by (r, c).Some cells on the board are called . On each cell of the board, there is written one of the following 5 characters  — U, D, L, R or X  — instructions for the player. Suppose that the current cell is (r, c). If the character is R, the player should move to the right cell (r, c+1), for L the player should move to the left cell (r, c-1), for U the player should move to the top cell (r-1, c), for D the player should move to the bottom cell (r+1, c). Finally, if the character in the cell is X, then this cell is the . The player should remain in this cell (the game for him isn't very interesting from now on).It is guaranteed that the characters are written in a way that the player will never have to step outside of the board, no matter at which cell he starts.As a player starts from a cell, he moves according to the character in the current cell. The player keeps moving until he lands in a blocked zone. It is also possible that the player will keep moving infinitely long.For every of the n^2 cells of the board Alice, your friend, wants to know, how will the game go, if the player starts in this cell. For each starting cell of the board, she writes down the cell that the player stops at, or that the player never stops at all. She gives you the information she has written: for each cell (r, c) she wrote: It might be possible that Alice is trying to fool you and there's no possible grid that satisfies all the constraints Alice gave you. For the given information Alice provided you, you are required to decipher a possible board, or to determine that such a board doesn't exist. If there exist several different boards that satisfy the provided information, you can find any of them.
363	Team Building Alice, the president of club FCB, wants to build a team for the new volleyball tournament. The team should consist of p players playing in p different positions. She also recognizes the importance of audience support, so she wants to select k people as part of the audience.There are n people in Byteland. Alice needs to select exactly p players, one for each position, and exactly k members of the audience from this pool of n people. Her ultimate goal is to maximize the total strength of the club.The i-th of the n persons has an integer a_{i} associated with him — the strength he adds to the club if he is selected as a member of the audience.For each person i and for each position j, Alice knows s_{i, j}  — the strength added by the i-th person to the club if he is selected to play in the j-th position.Each person can be selected at most once as a player or a member of the audience. You have to choose exactly one player for each position.Since Alice is busy, she needs you to help her find the maximum possible strength of the club that can be achieved by an optimal choice of players and the audience.
364	Battalion Strength There are n officers in the Army of Byteland. Each officer has some power associated with him. The power of the i-th officer is denoted by p_{i}. As the war is fast approaching, the General would like to know the strength of the army.The strength of an army is calculated in a strange way in Byteland. The General selects a random subset of officers from these n officers and calls this subset a battalion.(All 2^n subsets of the n officers can be chosen equally likely, including empty subset and the subset of all officers).The strength of a battalion is calculated in the following way:Let the powers of the chosen officers be a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}, where a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k. The strength of this battalion is equal to a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \dots + a_{k-1}a_k. (If the size of Battalion is \leq 1, then the strength of this battalion is 0).The strength of the army is equal to the expected value of the strength of the battalion.As the war is really long, the powers of officers may change. Precisely, there will be q changes. Each one of the form i x indicating that p_{i} is changed to x.You need to find the strength of the army initially and after each of these q updates.Note that the changes are permanent.The strength should be found by modulo 10^{9}+7. Formally, let M=10^{9}+7. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q\not\equiv 0 \bmod M). Output the integer equal to p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod M. In other words, output such an integer x that 0 \leq x < M and x ⋅ q \equiv p \bmod M).
365	Journey Planning Tanya wants to go on a journey across the cities of Berland. There are n cities situated along the main railroad line of Berland, and these cities are numbered from 1 to n. Tanya plans her journey as follows. First of all, she will choose some city c_1 to start her journey. She will visit it, and after that go to some other city c_2 > c_1, then to some other city c_3 > c_2, and so on, until she chooses to end her journey in some city c_k > c_{k - 1}. So, the sequence of visited cities [c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k] should be strictly increasing.There are some additional constraints on the sequence of cities Tanya visits. Each city i has a beauty value b_i associated with it. If there is only one city in Tanya's journey, these beauty values imply no additional constraints. But if there are multiple cities in the sequence, then for any pair of adjacent cities c_i and c_{i + 1}, the condition c_{i + 1} - c_i = b_{c_{i + 1}} - b_{c_i} must hold.For example, if n = 8 and b = [3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9], there are several three possible ways to plan a journey:There are some additional ways to plan a journey that are not listed above.Tanya wants her journey to be as beautiful as possible. The beauty value of the whole journey is the sum of beauty values over all visited cities. Can you help her to choose the optimal plan, that is, to maximize the beauty value of the journey?
366	Navigation System The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of n intersections, numbered from 1 to n and connected by m one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection v to another intersection u is the path that starts in v, ends in u and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection s and works in a building near the intersection t. Every day he gets from s to t by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: p_1, p_2, ..., p_k, where p_1 = s, p_k = t, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. .Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection s, the system chooses some shortest path from s to t and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as v. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from s to v, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from v as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection w instead, the navigator  the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at w, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from w to t and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at t: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system  the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path [1, 2, 3, 4] (s = 1, t = 4): Check the picture by the link Overall, we get 2 rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose [2, 3, 4] instead of [2, 6, 4] during the second step, there would be only 1 rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path [3, 4] during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same. Given this information (the map and Polycarp's path), can you determine the minimum and the maximum number of rebuilds that could have happened during the journey?
367	World of Darkraft: Battle for Azathoth Roma is playing a new expansion for his favorite game World of Darkraft. He made a new character and is going for his first grind.Roma has a choice to buy  of n different weapons and  of m different armor sets. Weapon i has attack modifier a_i and is worth ca_i coins, and armor set j has defense modifier b_j and is worth cb_j coins.After choosing his equipment Roma can proceed to defeat some monsters. There are p monsters he can try to defeat. Monster k has defense x_k, attack y_k and possesses z_k coins. Roma can defeat a monster if his weapon's attack modifier is larger than the monster's defense, and his armor set's defense modifier is larger than the monster's attack. That is, a monster k can be defeated with a weapon i and an armor set j if a_i > x_k and b_j > y_k. After defeating the monster, Roma takes all the coins from them. During the grind, Roma can defeat as many monsters as he likes. Monsters do not respawn, thus each monster can be defeated at most one.Thanks to Roma's excessive donations, we can assume that he has an infinite amount of in-game currency and can afford any of the weapons and armor sets. Still, he wants to maximize the profit of the grind. The profit is defined as the total coins obtained from all defeated monsters minus the cost of his equipment. Note that Roma  purchase a weapon and an armor set even if he can not cover their cost with obtained coins.Help Roma find the maximum profit of the grind.
368	Reachable Strings In this problem, we will deal with binary strings. Each character of a binary string is either a  or a . We will also deal with substrings; recall that a substring is a contiguous subsequence of a string. We denote the substring of string s starting from the l-th character and ending with the r-th character as s[l \dots r]. The characters of each string are numbered from 1.We can perform several operations on the strings we consider. Each operation is to choose a substring of our string and replace it with another string. There are two possible types of operations: replace  with , or replace  with . For example, if we apply exactly one operation to the string , it can be transformed into , , or .Binary string a is considered  from binary string b if there exists a sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_k such that s_1 = a, s_k = b, and for every i \in [1, k - 1], s_i can be transformed into s_{i + 1} using exactly one operation. Note that k can be equal to 1, i. e., .You are given a string t and q queries to it. Each query consists of three integers l_1, l_2 and len. To answer each query, you have to determine whether t[l_1 \dots l_1 + len - 1] is reachable from t[l_2 \dots l_2 + len - 1].
369	Treeland and Viruses There are n cities in Treeland connected with n - 1 bidirectional roads in such that a way that any city is reachable from any other; in other words, the graph of cities and roads is a tree. Treeland is preparing for a seasonal virus epidemic, and currently, they are trying to evaluate different infection scenarios.In each scenario, several cities are initially infected with different virus species. Suppose that there are k_i virus species in the i-th scenario. Let us denote v_j the initial city for the virus j, and s_j the propagation speed of the virus j. The spread of the viruses happens in turns: first virus 1 spreads, followed by virus 2, and so on. After virus k_i spreads, the process starts again from virus 1.A spread turn of virus j proceeds as follows. For each city x not infected with any virus at the start of the turn, at the end of the turn it becomes infected with virus j if and only if there is such a city y that:Once a city is infected with a virus, it stays infected indefinitely and can not be infected with any other virus. The spread stops once all cities are infected.You need to process q independent scenarios. Each scenario is described by k_i virus species and m_i important cities. For each important city determine which the virus it will be infected by in the end.
370	Blocks and Sensors Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). Every object in this game consists of three-dimensional blocks — axis-aligned cubes of size 1 \times 1 \times 1. These blocks are unaffected by gravity, so they can float in the air without support. The blocks are placed in cells of size 1 \times 1 \times 1; each cell either contains exactly one block or is empty. Each cell is represented by its coordinates (x, y, z) (the cell with these coordinates is a cube with opposite corners in (x, y, z) and (x + 1, y + 1, z + 1)) and its contents a_{x, y, z}; if the cell is empty, then a_{x, y, z} = 0, otherwise a_{x, y, z} is equal to the type of the block placed in it (the types are integers from 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5).Polycarp has built a large structure consisting of blocks. This structure can be enclosed in an axis-aligned rectangular parallelepiped of size n \times m \times k, containing all cells (x, y, z) such that x \in [1, n], y \in [1, m], and z \in [1, k]. After that, Polycarp has installed 2nm + 2nk + 2mk sensors around this parallelepiped. A sensor is a special block that sends a ray in some direction and shows the type of the first block that was hit by this ray (except for other sensors). The sensors installed by Polycarp are adjacent to the borders of the parallelepiped, and the rays sent by them are parallel to one of the coordinate axes and directed inside the parallelepiped. More formally, the sensors can be divided into 6 types:Polycarp has invited his friend Monocarp to play with him. Of course, as soon as Monocarp saw a large parallelepiped bounded by sensor blocks, he began to wonder what was inside of it. Polycarp didn't want to tell Monocarp the exact shape of the figure, so he provided Monocarp with the data from all sensors and told him to try guessing the contents of the parallelepiped by himself.After some hours of thinking, Monocarp has no clue about what's inside the sensor-bounded space. But he does not want to give up, so he decided to ask for help. Can you write a program that will analyze the sensor data and construct any figure that is consistent with it?
371	Contest for Robots Polycarp is preparing the first programming contest for robots. There are n problems in it, and a lot of robots are going to participate in it. Each robot solving the problem i gets p_i points, and the score of each robot in the competition is calculated as the sum of p_i over all problems i solved by it. For each problem, p_i is an integer not less than 1.Two corporations specializing in problem-solving robot manufacturing, "Robo-Coder Inc." and "BionicSolver Industries", are going to register two robots (one for each corporation) for participation as well. Polycarp knows the advantages and flaws of robots produced by these companies, so, for each problem, he knows precisely whether each robot will solve it during the competition. Knowing this, he can try predicting the results — or manipulating them. For some reason (which absolutely cannot involve bribing), Polycarp wants the "Robo-Coder Inc." robot to outperform the "BionicSolver Industries" robot in the competition. Polycarp wants to set the values of p_i in such a way that the "Robo-Coder Inc." robot gets  points than the "BionicSolver Industries" robot. However, if the values of p_i will be large, it may look very suspicious — so Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum value of p_i over all problems. Can you help Polycarp to determine the minimum possible upper bound on the number of points given for solving the problems?
372	Remove Adjacent You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of s be |s|. You may perform several operations on this string.In one operation, you can choose some index i and  the i-th character of s (s_i) if  of its adjacent characters is the  letter in the Latin alphabet for s_i. For example, the  letter for  is , the  letter for  is , the letter  has no  letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one. So, the index i should satisfy the condition 1 \le i \le |s| during each operation.For the character s_i adjacent characters are s_{i-1} and s_{i+1}. The first and the last characters of s both have only one adjacent character (unless |s| = 1).Consider the following example. Let s= .Your task is to find the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of operations optimally.
373	Unusual Competitions A bracketed sequence is called correct (regular) if by inserting "+" and "1" you can get a well-formed mathematical expression from it. For example, sequences "", "" and "" are correct, while "", "" and "" are not.The teacher gave Dmitry's class a very strange task — she asked every student to come up with a sequence of arbitrary length, consisting only of opening and closing brackets. After that all the students took turns naming the sequences they had invented. When Dima's turn came, he suddenly realized that all his classmates got the correct bracketed sequence, and whether he got the correct bracketed sequence, he did not know.Dima suspects now that he simply missed the word "correct" in the task statement, so now he wants to save the situation by modifying his sequence slightly. More precisely, he can  (possibly zero) perform the  operation.The reorder operation consists of choosing an arbitrary consecutive subsegment (substring) of the sequence and then reordering all the characters in it in an arbitrary way. Such operation takes l nanoseconds, where l is the length of the subsegment being reordered. It's easy to see that reorder operation doesn't change the number of opening and closing brackets. For example for "" he can choose the substring "" and do reorder "" (this operation will take 2 nanoseconds).Since Dima will soon have to answer, he wants to make his sequence correct as fast as possible. Help him to do this, or determine that it's impossible.
374	Present Catherine received an array of integers as a gift for March 8. Eventually she grew bored with it, and she started calculated various useless characteristics for it. She succeeded to do it for each one she came up with. But when she came up with another one —  of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it? Formally, you need to compute (a_1 + a_2) \oplus (a_1 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_1 + a_n) \\ \oplus (a_2 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_2 + a_n) \\ \ldots \\ \oplus (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\ Here x \oplus y is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. x  y in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: .
375	Instant Noodles Wu got hungry after an intense training session, and came to a nearby store to buy his favourite instant noodles. After Wu paid for his purchase, the cashier gave him an interesting task.You are given a bipartite graph with positive integers in all vertices of the  half. For a subset S of vertices of the  half we define N(S) as the set of all vertices of the right half adjacent to at least one vertex in S, and f(S) as the sum of all numbers in vertices of N(S). Find the greatest common divisor of f(S) for all possible non-empty subsets S (assume that GCD of empty set is 0).Wu is too tired after his training to solve this problem. Help him!
376	Reality Show A popular reality show is recruiting a new cast for the third season! n candidates numbered from 1 to n have been interviewed. The candidate i has aggressiveness level l_i, and recruiting this candidate will cost the show s_i roubles.The show host reviewes applications of all candidates from i=1 to i=n by increasing of their indices, and for each of them she decides whether to recruit this candidate or not. If aggressiveness level of the candidate i is strictly higher than that of any  candidates, then the candidate i will definitely be rejected. Otherwise the host may accept or reject this candidate at her own discretion. The host wants to choose the cast so that to maximize the total .The show makes revenue as follows. For each aggressiveness level v a corresponding profitability value c_v is specified, which can be positive as well as negative. All recruited participants enter the stage one by one by increasing of their indices. When the participant i enters the stage, events proceed as follows:It is allowed to select an empty set of participants (to choose neither of the candidates).The host wants to recruit the cast so that the total profit is maximized. The profit is calculated as the total revenue from the events on stage, less the total expenses to recruit all accepted participants (that is, their total s_i). Help the host to make the show as profitable as possible.
377	Median Mountain Range Berland — is a huge country with diverse geography. One of the most famous natural attractions of Berland is the "Median mountain range". This mountain range is n mountain peaks, located on one straight line and numbered in order of 1 to n. The height of the i-th mountain top is a_i. "Median mountain range" is famous for the so called  happening to it every day. At the moment of alignment simultaneously for each mountain from 2 to n - 1 its height becomes equal to the median height among it and two neighboring mountains. Formally, if before the alignment the heights were equal b_i, then after the alignment new heights a_i are as follows: a_1 = b_1, a_n = b_n and for all i from 2 to n - 1 a_i = \texttt{median}(b_{i-1}, b_i, b_{i+1}). The median of three integers is the second largest number among them. For example, \texttt{median}(5,1,2) = 2, and \texttt{median}(4,2,4) = 4.Recently, Berland scientists have proved that whatever are the current heights of the mountains, the alignment process will stabilize sooner or later, i.e. at some point the altitude of the mountains won't changing after the alignment any more. The government of Berland wants to understand how soon it will happen, i.e. to find the value of c — how many alignments will occur, which will change the height of at least one mountain. Also, the government of Berland needs to determine the heights of the mountains after c alignments, that is, find out what heights of the mountains stay forever. Help scientists solve this important problem!
378	Assigning Fares Mayor of city M. decided to launch several new metro lines during 2020. Since the city has a very limited budget, it was decided not to dig new tunnels but to use the existing underground network.The tunnel system of the city M. consists of n metro stations. The stations are connected with n - 1 bidirectional tunnels. Between every two stations v and u there is exactly one simple path. Each metro line the mayor wants to create is a simple path between stations a_i and b_i. Metro lines can intersects freely, that is, they can share common stations or even common tunnels. However, it's not yet decided which of two directions each line will go. More precisely, between the stations a_i and b_i the trains will go either from a_i to b_i, or from b_i to a_i, but not simultaneously.The city M uses complicated faring rules. Each station is assigned with a positive integer c_i — the fare zone of the station. The cost of travel from v to u is defined as c_u - c_v roubles. Of course, such travel only allowed in case there is a metro line, the trains on which go from v to u. Mayor doesn't want to have any travels with a negative cost, so it was decided to assign directions of metro lines and station fare zones in such a way, that fare zones are strictly increasing during any travel on any metro line.Mayor wants firstly assign each station a fare zone and then choose a lines direction, such that all fare zones are increasing along any line. In connection with the approaching celebration of the day of the city, the mayor wants to assign fare zones so that the maximum c_i will be as low as possible. Please help mayor to design a new assignment or determine if it's impossible to do. Please note that you only need to assign the fare zones optimally, you don't need to print lines' directions. This way, you solution will be considered correct if there will be a way to assign directions of every metro line, so that the fare zones will be strictly increasing along any movement of the trains.
379	Even Subset Sum Problem You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. Find a  subset of its elements such that their sum is  (i.e. divisible by 2) or determine that there is no such subset.Both the given array and required subset may contain equal values.
380	Count Subrectangles You are given an array a of length n and array b of length m both consisting of only integers 0 and 1. Consider a matrix c of size n \times m formed by following rule: c_{i, j} = a_i \cdot b_j (i.e. a_i multiplied by b_j). It's easy to see that c consists of only zeroes and ones too.How many  of size (area) k consisting only of ones are there in c?A  is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 (1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le n, 1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le m) a subrectangle c[x_1 \dots x_2][y_1 \dots y_2] is an intersection of the rows x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, \dots, x_2 and the columns y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, \dots, y_2.The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.
381	Yet Another Tetris Problem You are given some Tetris field consisting of n columns. The initial height of the i-th column of the field is a_i blocks. On top of these columns you can place  figures of size 2 \times 1 (i.e. the height of this figure is 2 blocks and the width of this figure is 1 block). Note that you  rotate these figures.Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.More formally, the problem can be described like this:The following process occurs while :And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.You have to answer t independent test cases.
382	Yet Another Palindrome Problem You are given an array a consisting of n integers.Your task is to determine if a has some  of length at least 3 that is a palindrome.Recall that an array b is called a  of the array a if b can be obtained by removing some (possibly, zero) elements from a (not necessarily consecutive) without changing the order of remaining elements. For example, [2], [1, 2, 1, 3] and [2, 3] are subsequences of [1, 2, 1, 3], but [1, 1, 2] and [4] are not.Also, recall that a palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, the array a of length n is the palindrome if a_i = a_{n - i - 1} for all i from 1 to n. For example, arrays [1234], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1] and [10, 100, 10] are palindromes, but arrays [1, 2] and [1, 2, 3, 1] are not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
383	Frog Jumps There is a frog staying to the left of the string s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n consisting of n characters (to be more precise, the frog initially stays at the cell 0). Each character of s is either '' or ''. It means that if the frog is staying at the i-th cell and the i-th character is '', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the i-th cell and the i-th character is '', the frog can jump only to the right. ..The frog wants to reach the n+1-th cell. The frog chooses some  value d  (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than d cells at once. I.e. if the i-th character is '' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range [max(0, i - d); i - 1], and if the i-th character is '' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range [i + 1; min(n + 1; i + d)].The frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of d such that the frog can reach the cell n+1 from the cell 0 if it can jump by no more than d cells at once. .You have to answer t independent test cases.
384	Pair of Topics The next lecture in a high school requires two topics to be discussed. The i-th topic is interesting by a_i units for the teacher and by b_i units for the students.The pair of topics i and j (i < j) is called  if a_i + a_j > b_i + b_j (i.e. it is more interesting for the teacher).Your task is to find the number of  pairs of topics.
385	Sleeping Schedule Vova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are h hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly n times. The i-th time he will sleep exactly after a_i hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is 0). Each time Vova sleeps  (in other words, h hours).Vova thinks that the i-th sleeping time is  if he starts to sleep between hours l and r inclusive.Vova can control himself and before the i-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after a_i hours or after a_i - 1 hours.Your task is to say the maximum number of  sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.
386	Maximum White Subtree You are given a tree consisting of n vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with n-1 edges. Each vertex v of this tree has a color assigned to it (a_v = 1 if the vertex v is white and 0 if the vertex v is black).You have to solve the following problem for each vertex v: what is the maximum difference between the number of white and the number of black vertices you can obtain if you choose some subtree of the given tree that  the vertex v? The subtree of the tree is the connected subgraph of the given tree. More formally, if you choose the subtree that contains cnt_w white vertices and cnt_b black vertices, you have to maximize cnt_w - cnt_b.
387	EhAb AnD gCd You are given a positive integer x. Find  such 2 positive integers a and b such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x.As a reminder, GCD(a,b) is the greatest integer that divides both a and b. Similarly, LCM(a,b) is the smallest integer such that both a and b divide it.It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a, b), you can output any of them.
388	CopyCopyCopyCopyCopy Ehab has an array a of length n. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of n copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.
389	Ehab and Path-etic MEXs You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:Here, MEX(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node u to node v.
390	Ehab the Xorcist Given 2 integers u and v, find the shortest array such that  of its elements is u, and the sum of its elements is v.
391	Ehab's REAL Number Theory Problem You are given an array a of length n that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
392	Ehab's Last Theorem It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.Given a connected graph with n vertices, you can choose to either:An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.
393	Bad Ugly Numbers You are given a integer n (n > 0). Find  integer s which satisfies these conditions, or report that there are no such numbers:In the decimal representation of s: 
394	Maximums Alicia has an array, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, of non-negative integers. For each 1 \leq i \leq n, she has found a non-negative integer x_i = max(0, a_1, \ldots, a_{i-1}). Note that for i=1, x_i = 0.For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, then x = \{0, 0, 1, 2, 2\}.Then, she calculated an array, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n: b_i = a_i - x_i.For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, b = \{0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 0-2, 3-2\} = \{0, 1, 1, -2, 1\}.Alicia gives you the values b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n and asks you to restore the values a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Can you help her solve the problem?
395	Permutation Partitions You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n and an integer k, such that 1 \leq k \leq n. A permutation means that every number from 1 to n is contained in p exactly once.Let's consider all partitions of this permutation into k disjoint segments. Formally, a partition is a set of segments \{[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_k, r_k]\}, such that:Two partitions are different if there exists a segment that lies in one partition but not the other.Let's calculate , defined as \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} {\max\limits_{l_i \leq j \leq r_i} {p_j}}, for all possible partitions of the permutation into k disjoint segments. Find the maximum possible partition value over all such partitions, and the number of partitions with this value. As the second value can be very large, you should find its remainder when divided by 998\,244\,353.
396	Bombs You are given a permutation, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.Imagine that some positions of the permutation contain bombs, such that there exists at least one position without a bomb.For some fixed configuration of bombs, consider the following process. Initially, there is an empty set, A.For each i from 1 to n:After the process is completed, A will be non-empty. The  equals the largest element in A.You are given another permutation, q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n.For each 1 \leq i \leq n, find the cost of a configuration of bombs such that there exists a bomb in positions q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{i-1}. For example, for i=1, you need to find the cost of a configuration without bombs, and for i=n, you need to find the cost of a configuration with bombs in positions q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_{n-1}.
397	Sum of Odd Integers You are given two integers n and k. Your task is to find if n can be represented as a sum of k  (not divisible by 2) integers or not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
398	Princesses and Princes The King of Berland Polycarp LXXXIV has n daughters. To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms. As a lucky coincidence there are n other kingdoms as well.So Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from 1 to n and the kingdoms from 1 to n. For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry.Polycarp LXXXIV is very busy, so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another.For the first daughter he takes  and marries the daughter to their prince. For the second daughter he takes . If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter. The process ends after the n-th daughter.For example, let there be 4 daughters and kingdoms, the lists daughters have are [2, 3], [1, 2], [3, 4], [3], respectively.In that case daughter 1 marries the prince of kingdom 2, daughter 2 marries the prince of kingdom 1, daughter 3 marries the prince of kingdom 3, leaving daughter 4 nobody to marry to.Actually, before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to. Effectively, that means that he can add exactly one kingdom to exactly one of his daughter's list. Polycarp LXXXIV wants to increase the number of married couples.Unfortunately, what he doesn't have the time for is determining what entry to add. If there is no way to increase the total number of married couples then output that the marriages are already optimal. Otherwise, find such an entry that the total number of married couples increases if Polycarp LXXXIV adds it.If there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.For your and our convenience you are asked to answer t independent test cases.
399	Game with Chips Petya has a rectangular Board of size n \times m. Initially, k chips are placed on the board, i-th chip is located in the cell at the intersection of sx_i-th row and sy_i-th column.In one action, Petya can move  to the left, right, down or up by 1 cell.If the chip was in the (x, y) cell, then after the operation: If the chip is located by the wall of the board, and the action chosen by Petya moves it towards the wall, then the chip remains in its current position.For each chip, Petya chose the position which it should visit. Note that it's not necessary for a chip to end up in this position.Since Petya does not have a lot of free time, he is ready to do no more than 2nm actions.You have to find out what actions Petya should do so that each chip visits the position that Petya selected for it at least once. Or determine that it is not possible to do this in 2nm actions.
400	Infinite Path You are given a colored permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. The i-th element of the permutation has color c_i.Let's define an  as infinite sequence i, p[i], p[p[i]], p[p[p[i]]] \dots where all elements have  (c[i] = c[p[i]] = c[p[p[i]]] = \dots).We can also define a multiplication of permutations a and b as permutation c = a \times b where c[i] = b[a[i]]. Moreover, we can define a power k of permutation p as p^k=\underbrace{p \times p \times \dots \times p}_{k \text{ times}}.Find the minimum k > 0 such that p^k has at least one infinite path (i.e. there is a position i in p^k such that the sequence starting from i is an infinite path).It can be proved that the answer always exists.
401	Count The Blocks You wrote down all integers from 0 to 10^n - 1, padding them with leading zeroes so their lengths are exactly n. For example, if n = 3 then you wrote out , , ..., , .A block in an integer x is a consecutive segment of equal digits that cannot be extended to the left or to the right.For example, in the integer 00027734000 there are three blocks of length 1, one block of length 2 and two blocks of length 3.For all integers i from 1 to n count the number of blocks of length i among the written down integers.Since these integers may be too large, print them modulo 998244353.
402	AND Segments You are given three integers n, k, m and m conditions (l_1, r_1, x_1), (l_2, r_2, x_2), \dots, (l_m, r_m, x_m).Calculate the number of distinct arrays a, consisting of n integers such that: Two arrays a and b are considered different if there exists such a position i that a_i \neq b_i. The number can be pretty large so print it modulo 998244353.
403	Divisibility Problem You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.
404	K-th Beautiful String For the given integer n (n > 2) let's write down all the strings of length n which contain n-2 letters '' and two letters '' in  (alphabetical) order.Recall that the string s of length n is lexicographically less than string t of length n, if there exists such i (1 \le i \le n), that s_i < t_i, and for any j (1 \le j < i) s_j = t_j. The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator  in modern programming languages.For example, if n=5 the strings are (the order does matter):It is easy to show that such a list of strings will contain exactly \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} strings.You are given n (n > 2) and k (1 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}). Print the k-th string from the list.
405	Ternary XOR A number is  if it contains only digits 0, 1 and 2. For example, the following numbers are ternary: 1022, 11, 21, 2002.You are given a long ternary number x. The first (leftmost) digit of x is guaranteed to be 2, the other digits of x can be 0, 1 or 2.Let's define the ternary XOR operation \odot of two ternary numbers a and b (both of length n) as a number c = a \odot b of length n, where c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% 3 (where \% is modulo operation). In other words, add the corresponding digits and take the remainders of the sums when divided by 3. For example, 10222 \odot 11021 = 21210.Your task is to find such ternary numbers a and b both of length n and both without leading zeros that a \odot b = x and max(a, b) is the minimum possible.You have to answer t independent test cases.
406	Carousel The round carousel consists of n figures of animals. Figures are numbered from 1 to n in order of the carousel moving. Thus, after the n-th figure the figure with the number 1 follows. Each figure has its own type — the type of the animal corresponding to this figure (the horse, the tiger and so on). The type of animal of the i-th figure equals t_i.You want to color each figure in one of the colors. You think that it's boring if the carousel contains two different figures (with the distinct types of animals) going one right after another and colored in the same color.Your task is to color the figures in such a way that the number of distinct colors used is the minimum possible and there are no figures of the different types going one right after another and colored in the same color. If you use exactly k distinct colors, then the colors of figures should be denoted with integers from 1 to k.
407	Tree Queries You are given a rooted tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. The root of the tree is a vertex number 1.A tree is a connected undirected graph with n-1 edges.You are given m queries. The i-th query consists of the set of k_i distinct vertices v_i[1], v_i[2], \dots, v_i[k_i]. Your task is to say if there is a path from the root to some vertex u such that each of the given k vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance 1 to some vertex of this path.
408	Make k Equal You are given the array a consisting of n elements and the integer k \le n.You want to obtain  k equal elements in the array a. In one move, you can make one of the following two operations:Your task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain  k equal elements in the array.
409	Dreamoon Likes Coloring Dreamoon likes coloring cells very much.There is a row of n cells. Initially, all cells are empty (don't contain any color). Cells are numbered from 1 to n.You are given an integer m and m integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m (1 \le l_i \le n)Dreamoon will perform m operations.In i-th operation, Dreamoon will choose a number p_i from range [1, n-l_i+1] (inclusive) and will paint all cells from p_i to p_i+l_i-1 (inclusive) in i-th color. Note that cells may be colored more one than once, in this case, cell will have the color from the latest operation.Dreamoon hopes that after these m operations, all colors will appear at least once and all cells will be colored. Please help Dreamoon to choose p_i in each operation to satisfy all constraints.
410	Dreamoon Likes Sequences Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS: You are given two integers d, m, find the number of arrays a, satisfying the following constraints:Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo m.
411	Drazil Likes Heap Drazil likes heap very much. So he created a problem with heap:There is a max heap with a height h implemented on the array. The details of this heap are the following:This heap contains exactly 2^h - 1  positive non-zero integers. All integers are distinct. These numbers are stored in the array a indexed from 1 to 2^h-1. For any 1 < i < 2^h, a[i] < a[\left \lfloor{\frac{i}{2}}\right \rfloor].Now we want to reduce the height of this heap such that the height becomes g with exactly 2^g-1 numbers in heap. To reduce the height, we should perform the following action 2^h-2^g times:Choose an index i, which contains an element and call the following function f in index i:Note that we suppose that if a[i]=0, then index i don't contain an element.After all operations, the remaining 2^g-1 element must be located in indices from 1 to 2^g-1. Now Drazil wonders what's the minimum possible sum of the remaining 2^g-1 elements. Please find this sum and find a sequence of the function calls to achieve this value.
412	Dreamoon Likes Strings Dreamoon likes strings. Today he created a game about strings:String s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n is  if and only if for each 1 \le i < n, s_i \ne s_{i+1}.Initially, Dreamoon has a string a. In each step Dreamoon can choose a  substring of a and remove it. Then he should concatenate the remaining characters (in the same order).Dreamoon wants to use the smallest number of steps to make a empty. Please help Dreamoon, and print any sequence of the smallest number of steps to make a empty.
413	Dreamoon Loves AA There is a string of length n+1 of characters 'A' and 'B'. The first character and last character of the string are equal to 'A'.You are given m indices p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m (0-indexation) denoting the other indices of characters 'A' in the string. Let's denote the minimum distance between two neighboring 'A' as l, and maximum distance between neighboring 'A' as r.For example, (l,r) of string "ABBAABBBA" is (1,4).And let's denote the  of a string as the value of r-l.Now Dreamoon wants to change exactly k characters from 'B' to 'A', and he wants to make the  of the string as small as possible.Please calculate the required minimum possible value of balance degree.
414	Dreamoon and Ranking Collection Dreamoon is a big fan of the Codeforces contests.One day, he claimed that he will collect all the places from 1 to 54 after two more rated contests. It's amazing!Based on this, you come up with the following problem:There is a person who participated in n Codeforces rounds. His place in the first round is a_1, his place in the second round is a_2, ..., his place in the n-th round is a_n.You are given a positive non-zero integer x.Please, find the largest v such that this person can collect all the places from 1 to v after x more rated contests.In other words, you need to find the largest v, such that it is possible, that after x more rated contests, for each 1 \leq i \leq v, there will exist a contest where this person took the i-th place.For example, if n=6, x=2 and a=[3,1,1,5,7,10] then answer is v=5, because if on the next two contest he will take places 2 and 4, then he will collect all places from 1 to 5, so it is possible to get v=5.
415	Dreamoon Likes Permutations The sequence of m integers is called the  if it contains all integers from 1 to m exactly once. The number m is called the length of the permutation.Dreamoon has two permutations p_1 and p_2 of non-zero lengths l_1 and l_2.Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence a of length l_1 + l_2. First l_1 elements of a is the permutation p_1 and next l_2 elements of a is the permutation p_2. You are given the sequence a, and you need to find two permutations p_1 and p_2. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)
416	Exercising Walk Alice has a cute cat. To keep her cat fit, Alice wants to design an exercising walk for her cat! Initially, Alice's cat is located in a cell (x,y) of an infinite grid. According to Alice's theory, cat needs to move: Note that the moves can be performed in an . For example, if the cat has to move 1 step left, 3 steps right and 2 steps down, then the walk right, down, left, right, right, down is valid.Alice, however, is worrying that her cat might get lost if it moves far away from her. So she hopes that her cat is  in the area [x_1,x_2]\times [y_1,y_2], i.e. for every cat's position (u,v) of a walk x_1 \le u \le x_2 and y_1 \le v \le y_2 holds.Also, note that the cat can visit the same cell multiple times.Can you help Alice find out if there exists a walk satisfying her wishes?Formally, the walk should contain exactly a+b+c+d unit moves (a to the left, b to the right, c to the down, d to the up). Alice can do the moves in  order. Her current position (u, v) should  satisfy the constraints: x_1 \le u \le x_2, y_1 \le v \le y_2. The staring point is (x, y).You are required to answer t test cases .
417	Composite Coloring A positive integer is called  if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n.She wants to choose an integer m \le 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.Alice showed already that if all a_i \le 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m \le 11.Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.
418	K-Complete Word Word s of length n is called k-complete if For example, "" is a 3-complete word, while "" is not.Bob is given a word s of length n consisting of only lowercase Latin letters and an integer k, such that n is divisible by k. He wants to convert s to any k-complete word.To do this Bob can choose some i (1 \le i \le n) and replace the letter at position i with some other lowercase Latin letter.So now Bob wants to know the minimum number of letters he has to replace to convert s to any k-complete word.Note that Bob can do zero changes if the word s is already k-complete.You are required to answer t test cases .
419	Walk on Matrix Bob is playing a game named "Walk on Matrix".In this game, player is given an n \times m matrix A=(a_{i,j}), i.e. the element in the i-th row in the j-th column is a_{i,j}. Initially, player is located at position (1,1) with score a_{1,1}. To reach the goal, position (n,m), player can move right or down, i.e. move from (x,y) to (x,y+1) or (x+1,y), as long as player is still on the matrix.However, each move changes player's score to the  of the current score and the value at the position he moves to.Bob can't wait to find out the maximum score he can get using the tool he recently learnt  — dynamic programming. Here is his algorithm for this problem. However, he suddenly realize that the algorithm above fails to output the maximum score for some matrix A. Thus, for any given non-negative integer k, he wants to find out an n \times m matrix A=(a_{i,j}) such that It can be shown that for any given integer k such that 0 \le k \le 10^5, there exists a matrix satisfying the above constraints.Please help him with it!
420	Height All the Same Alice has got addicted to a game called Sirtet recently.In Sirtet, player is given an n \times m grid. Initially a_{i,j} cubes are stacked up in the cell (i,j). Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Player can perform the following operations: Cubes mentioned above are identical in height.Here is an illustration of the game. States on the right are obtained by performing one of the above operations on the state on the left, and grey cubes are added due to the operation.Player's goal is to  (i.e. so that each cell has the same number of cubes in it) using above operations. Alice, however, has found out that on some starting grids she may never reach the goal no matter what strategy she uses. Thus, she is wondering the number of initial grids such that Please help Alice with it. Notice that the answer might be large, please output the desired value modulo 998,244,353.
421	Independent Set Eric is the teacher of graph theory class. Today, Eric teaches independent set and edge-induced subgraph.Given a graph G=(V,E), an  is a subset of vertices V' \subset V such that for every pair u,v \in V', (u,v) \not \in E (i.e. no edge in E connects two vertices from V').An  consists of a subset of edges E' \subset E and all the vertices in the original graph that are incident on at least one edge in the subgraph.Given E' \subset E, denote G[E'] the edge-induced subgraph such that E' is the edge set of the subgraph.

Formally, calculate \sum \limits_{\emptyset \not= E' \subset E} w(G[E']).Show Eric that you are smarter than his students by providing the correct answer as quickly as possible. Note that the answer might be large, you should output the answer modulo 998,244,353.
422	Little Artem Young boy Artem tries to paint a picture, and he asks his mother Medina to help him. Medina is very busy, that's why she asked for your help.Artem wants to paint an n \times m board. Each cell of the board should be colored in white or black. Lets B be the number of black cells that have at least one white neighbor adjacent by the side. Let W be the number of white cells that have at least one black neighbor adjacent by the side. A coloring is called  if B = W + 1. The first coloring shown below has B=5 and W=4 (all cells have at least one neighbor with the opposite color). However, the second coloring is not  as it has B=4, W=4 (only the bottom right cell doesn't have a neighbor with the opposite color).Please, help Medina to find any  coloring. It's guaranteed that under given constraints the solution always exists. If there are several solutions, output any of them.
423	Kind Anton Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem:There are two arrays of integers a and b of length n. It turned out that array a contains only elements from the set \{-1, 0, 1\}.Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:For example, if you are given array [1, -1, 0], you can transform it only to [1, -1, -1], [1, 0, 0] and [1, -1, 1] by one operation.Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array a so that it becomes equal to array b. Can you help him?
424	Eugene and an array Eugene likes working with arrays. And today he needs your help in solving one challenging task.An array c is a subarray of an array b if c can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.Let's call a nonempty array  if for every nonempty subarray of this array, sum of the elements of this subarray is nonzero. For example, array [-1, 2, -3] is , as all arrays [-1], [-1, 2], [-1, 2, -3], [2], [2, -3], [-3] have nonzero sums of elements. However, array [-1, 2, -1, -3] isn't , as his subarray [-1, 2, -1] has sum of elements equal to 0.Help Eugene to calculate the number of nonempty  subarrays of a given array a.
425	Challenges in school №41 There are n children, who study at the school №41. It is well-known that they are good mathematicians. Once at a break, they arranged a challenge for themselves. All children arranged in a row and turned heads either to the left or to the right.Children can do the following: in one second several pairs of neighboring children who are  can  turn the head in the opposite direction. For instance, the one who was looking at the right neighbor turns left and vice versa for the second child. Moreover, every second  pair of neighboring children performs such action. They are going to finish when there is no pair of neighboring children who are looking at each other. You are given the number n, the initial arrangement of children and the number k. You have to find a way for the children to act if they want to finish the process in exactly k seconds. More formally, for each of the k moves, you need to output the numbers of the children who turn left during this move.For instance, for the configuration shown below and k = 2 children can do the following steps: It is guaranteed that if the solution exists, it takes not more than n^2 "headturns".
426	Road to 1600 Egor wants to achieve a rating of 1600 points on the well-known chess portal ChessForces and he needs your help!Before you start solving the problem, Egor wants to remind you how the chess pieces move. Chess  moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The  walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an N \times N board. Each cell of the board has a number from 1 to N ^ 2 in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number 1. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules: Egor should find an N \times N board on which the rook pays  than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such N \times N numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.
427	Kate and imperfection Kate has a set S of n integers \{1, \dots, n\} . She thinks that  of a subset M \subseteq S is equal to the  of gcd(a, b) over all pairs (a, b) such that both a and b are in M and a \neq b. Kate is a very neat girl and for each k \in \{2, \dots, n\} she wants to find a subset that has the  among all subsets in S of size k. There can be more than one subset with the smallest imperfection and the same size, but you don't need to worry about it. Kate wants to find all the subsets herself, but she needs your help to find the smallest possible imperfection for each size k, will name it I_k. Please, help Kate to find I_2, I_3, ..., I_n.
428	Level Statistics Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by 1. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by 1 as well.  (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.So he peeked at the stats n times and wrote down n pairs of integers — (p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \dots, (p_n, c_n), where p_i is the number of plays at the i-th moment of time and c_i is the number of clears at the same moment of time.  (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.Help him to check the correctness of his records.For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.
429	Middle Class Many years ago Berland was a small country where only n people lived. Each person had some savings: the i-th one had a_i burles.The government considered a person as wealthy if he had at least x burles. To increase the number of wealthy people Berland decided to carry out several reforms. Each reform looked like that: For example, consider the savings as list [5, 1, 2, 1]: if the government chose the 1-st and the 3-rd persons then it, at first, will take all 5 + 2 = 7 burles and after that will return 3.5 burles to the chosen people. As a result, the savings will become [3.5, 1, 3.5, 1].A lot of data was lost from that time, so we don't know how many reforms were implemented and to whom. All we can do is ask you to calculate the maximum possible number of wealthy people after several (maybe zero) reforms.
430	Circle of Monsters You are playing another computer game, and now you have to slay n monsters. These monsters are standing in a circle, numbered clockwise from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th monster has a_i health.You may shoot the monsters to kill them. Each shot requires exactly one bullet and decreases the health of the targeted monster by 1 (deals 1 damage to it). Furthermore, when the health of some monster i becomes 0 or less than 0, it dies and explodes, dealing b_i damage to the next monster (monster i + 1, if i < n, or monster 1, if i = n). If the next monster is already dead, then nothing happens. If the explosion kills the next monster, it explodes too, damaging the monster after it and possibly triggering another explosion, and so on.You have to calculate the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all n monsters in the circle.
431	Minimum Euler Cycle You are given a  graph K_n with n vertices: each pair of vertices u \neq v in K_n have both directed edges (u, v) and (v, u); there are no self-loops.You should find such a cycle in K_n that visits every directed edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).We can write such cycle as a list of n(n - 1) + 1 vertices v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_{n(n - 1) - 1}, v_{n(n - 1)}, v_{n(n - 1) + 1} = v_1 — a visiting order, where each (v_i, v_{i + 1}) occurs exactly once.Find the  such cycle. It's not hard to prove that the cycle always exists.Since the answer can be too large print its [l, r] segment, in other words, v_l, v_{l + 1}, \dots, v_r.
432	Divisor Paths You are given a positive integer D. Let's build the following graph from it: For example, here is the graph for D=12: Edge (4,12) has weight 3 because 12 has divisors [1,2,3,4,6,12] and 4 has divisors [1,2,4]. Thus, there are 3 divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 4 — [3,6,12].There is no edge between 3 and 2 because 3 is not divisible by 2. There is no edge between 12 and 3 because \frac{12}{3}=4 is not a prime.Let the length of the path between some vertices v and u in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] has length 1+2+2+3+1+2=11. The empty path has length 0.So the shortest path between two vertices v and u is the path that has the minimal possible length.Two paths a and b are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position i such that a_i and b_i are different edges.You are given q queries of the following form: The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo 998244353.
433	Strange Function Let's denote the following function f. This function takes an array a of length n and returns an array. Initially the result is an empty array. For each integer i from 1 to n we add element a_i to the end of the resulting array if it is greater than all previous elements (more formally, if a_i > \max\limits_{1 \le j < i}a_j). Some examples of the function f:You are given two arrays: array a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n and array b_1, b_2, \dots , b_m. You can delete some elements of array a (possibly zero). To delete the element a_i, you have to pay p_i coins (the value of p_i can be negative, then you get |p_i| coins, if you delete this element). Calculate the minimum number of coins (possibly negative) you have to spend for fulfilling equality f(a) = b.
434	Candies and Two Sisters There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have n candies.

You have to construct a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that  of length a has  b distinct letters. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer t independent test cases.Recall that the substring s[l \dots r] is the string s_l, s_{l+1}, \dots, s_{r} and its length is r - l + 1. In this problem you are only interested in substrings of length a.
436	Two Teams Composing You have n students under your control and you have to compose  consisting of some subset of your students. Each student had his own skill, the i-th student skill is denoted by an integer a_i (different students can have the same skills).So, about the teams. Firstly, these two teams should have the same size. Two more constraints:Note that it is permissible that some student of the first team has the same skill as a student of the second team.Consider some examples (skills are given):Your task is to find the maximum possible size x for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is x (skills in the first team needed to be unique, skills in the second team should be the same between them). A student cannot be part of more than one team.You have to answer t independent test cases.

439	Linova and Kingdom Writing light novels is the most important thing in Linova's life. Last night, Linova dreamed about a fantastic kingdom. She began to write a light novel for the kingdom as soon as she woke up, and of course, she is the queen of it.There are n cities and n-1 two-way roads connecting pairs of cities in the kingdom. From any city, you can reach any other city by walking through some roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to n, and the city 1 is the capital of the kingdom. So, the kingdom has a tree structure.As the queen, Linova plans to choose  k cities developing industry, while the other cities will develop tourism. The capital also can be either industrial or tourism city.A meeting is held in the capital once a year. To attend the meeting, each  sends an envoy. All envoys will follow the shortest path from the departure city to the capital (which is unique).Traveling in tourism cities is pleasant. For each envoy, his  is equal to the number of  on his path.In order to be a queen loved by people, Linova wants to choose k cities which can maximize the sum of  of all envoys. Can you calculate the maximum sum for her?
440	Xenia and Colorful Gems Xenia is a girl being born a noble. Due to the inflexibility and harshness of her family, Xenia has to find some ways to amuse herself.Recently Xenia has bought n_r red gems, n_g green gems and n_b blue gems. Each of the gems has a weight.Now, she is going to pick three gems.Xenia loves colorful things, so she will pick exactly one gem of each color.Xenia loves balance, so she will try to pick gems with little difference in weight.Specifically, supposing the weights of the picked gems are x, y and z, Xenia wants to find the minimum value of (x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2. As her dear friend, can you help her?
441	Kaavi and Magic Spell Kaavi, the mysterious fortune teller, deeply believes that one's fate is inevitable and unavoidable. Of course, she makes her living by predicting others' future. While doing divination, Kaavi believes that magic spells can provide great power for her to see the future. Kaavi has a string T of length m and all the strings with the prefix T are magic spells. Kaavi also has a string S of length n and an empty string A.During the divination, Kaavi needs to perform a sequence of operations. There are two different operations:Kaavi can perform  n operations. To finish the divination, she wants to know the number of different operation sequences to make A a magic spell (i.e. with the prefix T). As her assistant, can you help her? The answer might be huge, so Kaavi only needs to know the answer modulo 998\,244\,353.Two operation sequences are considered different if they are different in length or there exists an i that their i-th operation is different. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. A prefix of a string S is a substring of S that occurs at the beginning of S.
442	Yui and Mahjong Set Yui is a girl who enjoys playing Mahjong.She has a mysterious set which consists of tiles (this set can be empty). Each tile has an integer value between 1 and n, and  in the set have the same value. So the set can contain at most n^2 tiles.You want to figure out which values are on the tiles. But Yui is shy, she prefers to play a guessing game with you.Let's call a set consisting of  tiles  if their values are the same. For example, \{2,\,2,\,2\} is a triplet, but \{2,\,3,\,3\} is not.Let's call a set consisting of  tiles  if their values are consecutive integers. For example, \{2,\,3,\,4\} is a straight, but \{1,\,3,\,5\} is not.At first, Yui gives you the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the initial set respectively. After that, you can insert a tile with an integer value between 1 and n into the set . Every time you insert a tile, you will get the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the current set as well.Note that two tiles with the same value are treated different. In other words, in the set \{1,\,1,\,2,\,2,\,3\} you can find 4 subsets \{1,\,2,\,3\}.Try to guess the number of tiles in the initial set with value i for all integers i from 1 to n.

Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest. Now she is solving the following problem.You are given four positive integers a, b, c, d, such that a \leq b \leq c \leq d. Your task is to find three integers x, y, z, satisfying the following conditions:Ichihime desires to get the cookie, but the problem seems too hard for her. Can you help her?
445	Kana and Dragon Quest game Kana was just an ordinary high school girl before a talent scout discovered her. Then, she became an idol. But different from the stereotype, she is also a gameholic. One day Kana gets interested in a new adventure game called . In this game, her quest is to beat a dragon.The dragon has a  of x initially. When its  goes to 0 or under 0, it will be defeated. In order to defeat the dragon, Kana can cast the two following types of spells. Assume that the dragon's current  is h, after  this spell its  will become \left\lfloor \frac{h}{2} \right\rfloor + 10. Here \left\lfloor \frac{h}{2} \right\rfloor denotes h divided by two, rounded down.This spell will decrease the dragon's  by 10. Assume that the dragon's current  is h, after  this spell its  will be lowered to h-10.Due to some reasons Kana can only   n  and m . She can cast the spells in any order and  cast all the spells. Kana isn't good at math, so you are going to help her to find out whether it is possible to defeat the dragon.
446	Powered Addition You have an array a of length n. For every positive integer x you are going to perform the following operation during the x-th second:You have to make a nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number T such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most T seconds.Array a is nondecreasing if and only if a_{1} \le a_{2} \le \ldots \le a_{n}.You have to answer t independent test cases.
447	Edge Weight Assignment You have unweighted tree of n vertices. You have to assign a  weight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:Note that you can put  positive integers (like 10^{(10^{10})}).It's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define f as  in assignment. In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex 1 and vertex 6 (3, 4, 5, 4) is not 0. What are the minimum and the maximum possible values of f for the given tree? Find and print both.
448	Perfect Triples Consider the infinite sequence s of positive integers, created by repeating the following steps:You have integer n. Find the n-th element of s.You have to answer t independent test cases.A sequence a is lexicographically smaller than a sequence b if in the first position where a and b differ, the sequence a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.
449	Nested Rubber Bands You have a tree of n vertices. You are going to convert this tree into n rubber bands on infinitely large plane. Conversion rule follows:Now let's define following things: It can be proved that is it possible to make a conversion and sequence of nested rubber bands under given constraints.What is the maximum length of sequence of nested rubber bands can be obtained from given tree? Find and print it.
450	JYPnation The new nation consists of n cities and some roads between them. JYP has given some restrictions: JYP has given criteria for your diagram. For two cities A,B, let dis(A,B) be the smallest number of roads you have to go through to get from A to B. If it is not possible to walk from A to B, dis(A,B) = 614n. Then, the efficiency value is defined to be the sum of dis(A,B) for all ordered pairs of distinct cities (A,B)..You have drawn a design diagram that satisfies JYP's restrictions. Find the sum of dis(A,B) over all ordered pairs of cities (A,B) with A\neq B.
451	Filling Diamonds You have integer n. Calculate how many ways are there to fully cover belt-like area of 4n-2 triangles with diamond shapes. Diamond shape consists of two triangles. You can move, rotate or flip the shape, but you cannot scale it. 2 coverings are different if some 2 triangles are covered by the same diamond shape in one of them and by different diamond shapes in the other one.Please look at pictures below for better understanding. These are the figures of the area you want to fill for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. You have to answer t independent test cases.
452	Sorted Adjacent Differences You have array of n numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}. Rearrange these numbers to satisfy |a_{1} - a_{2}| \le |a_{2} - a_{3}| \le \ldots \le |a_{n-1} - a_{n}|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x. It's always possible to find such rearrangement.Note that all numbers in a are not necessarily different. In other words, some numbers of a may be same.You have to answer independent t test cases.
453	Nastya and Strange Generator Denis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.When he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of n steps. At the i-th step, a place is chosen for the number i (1 \leq i \leq n). The position for the number i is defined as follows:Let's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:Let n = 5 and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers 1, 2, 3 in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number 4:Satisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.Unfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help. It is necessary to define whether the written permutation could be obtained using the described algorithm if the generator always selects the position Denis needs.
454	Nastya and Scoreboard The poor boy was very upset because of that. He was so sad that he punched some kind of scoreboard with numbers. The numbers are displayed in the same way as on an electronic clock: each digit position consists of 7 segments, which can be turned on or off to display different numbers. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed: After the punch, some segments stopped working, that is, some segments might stop glowing if they glowed earlier. But Denis remembered how many sticks were glowing and how many are glowing now. Denis broke  k segments and he knows which sticks are working now. Denis came up with the question: what is the maximum possible number that can appear on the board if you turn on exactly k sticks (which are off now)? It is  that the number includes leading zeros.
455	Nastya and Unexpected Guest On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.Formally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.He knows many different integers d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_m, where 0 \leq d_i \leq n  — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.
456	Nastya and Time Machine The map of the city where they live has a lot of squares, some of which are connected by roads. There is exactly one way between each pair of squares which does not visit any vertex twice. It turns out that the graph of the city is a tree.Denis is located at vertex 1 at the time 0. He wants to visit every vertex at least once and get back as soon as possible.Denis can walk one road in 1 time. Unfortunately, the city is so large that it will take a very long time to visit all squares. Therefore, Denis took a desperate step. He pulled out his pocket time machine, which he constructed in his basement. With its help, Denis can change the time to any non-negative time, which is less than the current time.But the time machine has one feature. If the hero finds himself in the same place and at the same time twice, there will be an explosion of universal proportions and Nastya will stay unhappy. Therefore, Denis asks you to find him a route using a time machine that he will get around all squares and will return to the first and at the same time the maximum time in which he visited any square will be minimal.Formally, Denis's route can be represented as a sequence of pairs: \{v_1, t_1\}, \{v_2, t_2\}, \{v_3, t_3\}, \ldots, \{v_k, t_k\}, where v_i is number of square, and t_i is time in which the boy is now.The following conditions must be met:You need to find a route such that the maximum time in any square will be minimal, that is, the route for which \max{(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k)} will be the minimum possible.
457	Nastya and Bees A beehive is a connected undirected graph where bees and Nastya can move along the edges. A graph satisfies two properties: You win if at least one of the bees and Nastya are in the same vertex at any time of the game.If this situation does not occur after n moves, then you lose.
458	Nastya and CBS A string s is given. It consists of k kinds of pairs of brackets. Each bracket has the form t  — it is an integer, such that 1 \leq |t| \leq k. If the bracket has a form t, then: Thus, there are k types of pairs of brackets in total. The queries need to be answered: 
459	Nastya and Rice Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the floor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.In total, Nastya dropped n grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from a - b to a + b, inclusive (numbers a and b are known), and the whole package of n grains weighs from c - d to c + d grams, inclusive (numbers c and d are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all n grains in it.Help Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the i-th grain weighs some integer number x_i (a - b \leq x_i \leq a + b), and in total they weigh from c - d to c + d, inclusive (c - d \leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \leq c + d).
460	Nastya and Door On February 14 Denis decided to give Valentine to Nastya and did not come up with anything better than to draw a huge red heart on the door of the length k (k \ge 3). Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.Mountains are described by a sequence of heights a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n in order from left to right (k \le n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a_i \ne a_{i+1} for all i from 1 to n-1).Peaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a_{i - 1} < a_i and a_i > a_{i + 1}. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment . For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].To break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \le l \le n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].Nastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value l is minimal.Formally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that has the maximum number of peaks. Among all such segments, you need to find the segment that has the minimum possible value l.
461	Road To Zero You are given two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations:  Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. x = y = 0. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from x=1, y=0 to x=y=0.Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.
462	Binary Period Let's say string s has period k if s_i = s_{i + k} for all i from 1 to |s| - k (|s| means length of string s) and k is the minimum positive integer with this property.Some examples of a period: for s="" the period is k=2, for s="" the period is k=1, for s="" the period is k=2, for s="" the period is k=4.You are given string t consisting only of 's and 's and you need to find such string s that:Let us recall that t is a subsequence of s if t can be derived from s by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, t="" is a subsequence of s="".
463	Yet Another Counting Problem You are given two integers a and b, and q queries. The i-th query consists of two numbers l_i and r_i, and the answer to it is the number of integers x such that l_i \le x \le r_i, and ((x \bmod a) \bmod b) \ne ((x \bmod b) \bmod a). Calculate the answer for each query.Recall that y \bmod z is the remainder of the division of y by z. For example, 5 \bmod 3 = 2, 7 \bmod 8 = 7, 9 \bmod 4 = 1, 9 \bmod 9 = 0.
464	Multiple Testcases So you decided to hold a contest on Codeforces. You prepared the problems: statements, solutions, checkers, validators, tests... Suddenly, your coordinator asks you to change all your tests to multiple testcases in the easiest problem!Initially, each test in that problem is just an array. The maximum size of an array is k. For simplicity, the contents of arrays don't matter. You have n tests — the i-th test is an array of size m_i (1 \le m_i \le k).Your coordinator asks you to distribute all of your arrays into multiple testcases. Each testcase can include multiple arrays. However, each testcase should include no more than c_1 arrays of size  (\ge 1), no more than c_2 arrays of size , \dots, no more than c_k arrays of size . Also, c_1 \ge c_2 \ge \dots \ge c_k.So now your goal is to create the new testcases in such a way that: Print the minimum possible number of testcases you can achieve and the sizes of arrays included in each testcase.
465	Placing Rooks Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n \times n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, . For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.
466	Make It Ascending You are given an array a consisting of n elements. You may apply several operations (possibly zero) to it.During each operation, you choose two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n; i \ne j), increase a_j by a_i, and remove the i-th element from the array (so the indices of all elements to the right to it decrease by 1, and n also decreases by 1).Your goal is to make the array a strictly ascending. That is, the condition a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n should hold (where n is the resulting size of the array).Calculate the minimum number of actions required to make the array strictly ascending.
467	Candies Recently Vova found n candy wrappers. He remembers that he bought x candies during the first day, 2x candies during the second day, 4x candies during the third day, \dots, 2^{k-1} x candies during the k-th day. But there is an issue: Vova remembers neither x nor k but he is sure that x and k are positive integers and k > 1.Vova will be satisfied if you tell him  integer x so there is an integer k>1 that x + 2x + 4x + \dots + 2^{k-1} x = n. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. .You have to answer t independent test cases.
468	Balanced Array You are given a positive integer n, it is guaranteed that n is even (i.e. divisible by 2).You want to construct the array a of length n such that: If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is  that the answer exists.You have to answer t independent test cases.
469	Alternating Subsequence Recall that the sequence b is a a subsequence of the sequence a if b can be derived from a by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if a=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1], then possible subsequences are: [1, 1, 1, 1], [3] and [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1], but not [3, 2, 3] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 2].You are given a sequence a consisting of n positive and negative elements (there is no zeros in the sequence).Your task is to choose  (length)  subsequence of the given sequence (i.e. the sign of each next element is the opposite from the sign of the current element, like positive-negative-positive and so on or negative-positive-negative and so on). Among all such subsequences, you have to choose one which has the  of elements.In other words, if the maximum length of  subsequence is k then your task is to find the  of elements of some  subsequence of length k.You have to answer t independent test cases.
470	Constant Palindrome Sum You are given an array a consisting of n integers (it is guaranteed that n is even, i.e. divisible by 2). All a_i does not exceed some integer k.Your task is to replace the  number of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index i from 1 to n and replace a_i with some integer in range [1; k]) to satisfy the following conditions:You have to answer t independent test cases.
471	Weights Distributing You are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (which represents the map of Bertown) and the array of prices p of length m. It is guaranteed that there is a path between each pair of vertices (districts).Mike has planned a trip from the vertex (district) a to the vertex (district) b and then from the vertex (district) b to the vertex (district) c. He can visit the same district twice or more. But there is one issue: authorities of the city want to set a price for using the road so if someone goes along the road then he should pay the price corresponding to this road (). The list of prices that will be used p is ready and they just want to distribute it between all roads in the town in such a way that each price from the array corresponds to exactly one road.You are a good friend of Mike (and suddenly a mayor of Bertown) and want to help him to make his trip as cheap as possible. So, your task is to distribute prices between roads in such a way that if Mike chooses the optimal path then the price of the trip is the  possible. .You have to answer t independent test cases.
472	Restore the Permutation by Sorted Segments We guessed a permutation p consisting of n integers. The permutation of length n is the array of length n where each element from 1 to n appears exactly once. This permutation is a secret for you.For each position r from 2 to n we chose some other index l (l < r) and gave you the segment p_l, p_{l + 1}, \dots, p_r in  order (i.e. we rearranged the elements of this segment in a way that the elements of this segment are sorted). Thus, you are given exactly n-1 segments of the initial permutation but elements inside each segment are sorted. The segments are given to you in random order.For example, if the secret permutation is p=[3, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5] then the possible given set of segments can be:Your task is to find  suitable permutation (i.e. any permutation corresponding to the given input data). It is guaranteed that the input data corresponds to some permutation (i.e. such permutation exists).You have to answer t independent test cases.
473	Hilbert's Hotel Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, . Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).For any integer k and positive integer n, let k\bmod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. More formally, r=k\bmod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that k-r is divisible by n. It always holds that 0\le k\bmod n\le n-1. For example, 100\bmod 12=4 and (-1337)\bmod 3=1.Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of n integers a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}. Then for each integer k, the guest in room k is moved to room number k+a_{k\bmod n}.After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.
474	Monopole Magnets A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.There is an n\times m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).
475	Quantifier Question Logical quantifiers are very useful tools for expressing claims about a set. For this problem, let's focus on the set of real numbers specifically.  There are two kinds of quantifiers: universal (\forall) and existential (\exists). You can read more about them .The universal quantifier is used to make a claim that a statement holds . For example:The existential quantifier is used to make a claim that  for which the statement holds. For example:Moreover, these quantifiers can be nested. For example:There are n variables x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n, and you are given some formula of the form  f(x_1,\dots,x_n):=(x_{j_1}<x_{k_1})\land (x_{j_2}<x_{k_2})\land \cdots\land (x_{j_m}<x_{k_m}), where \land denotes logical AND. That is, f(x_1,\ldots, x_n) is true if every inequality x_{j_i}<x_{k_i} holds. Otherwise, if at least one inequality does not hold, then f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) is false.Your task is to assign quantifiers Q_1,\ldots,Q_n to either universal (\forall) or existential (\exists) so that the statement  Q_1 x_1, Q_2 x_2, \ldots, Q_n x_n, f(x_1,\ldots, x_n) is true, and , or determine that the statement is false for every possible assignment of quantifiers. For example, if f(x_1,x_2):=(x_1<x_2) then you are not allowed to make x_2 appear first and use the statement \forall x_2,\exists x_1, x_1<x_2. If you assign Q_1=\exists and Q_2=\forall, it will  be interpreted as \exists x_1,\forall x_2,x_1<x_2.
476	Résumé Review You have completed many programming projects. In fact, there are exactly n types of programming projects, and you have completed a_i projects of type i. Your résumé has limited space, but you want to carefully choose them in such a way that maximizes your chances of getting hired.You want to include several projects of the same type to emphasize your expertise, but you also don't want to include so many that the low-quality projects start slipping in. Specifically, you determine the following quantity to be a good indicator of your chances of getting hired: f(b_1,\ldots,b_n)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n b_i(a_i-b_i^2). Here, b_i denotes the number of projects of type i you include in your résumé. Of course, you cannot include more projects than you have completed, so you require 0\le b_i \le a_i for all i.Your résumé only has enough room for k projects, and you will absolutely not be hired if your résumé has empty space, so you require \sum\limits_{i=1}^n b_i=k.Find values for b_1,\ldots, b_n that maximize the value of f(b_1,\ldots,b_n) while satisfying the above two constraints.
477	Train Tracks There are n stations and m trains. The stations are connected by n-1 one-directional railroads that form a tree rooted at station 1. All railroads are pointed in the direction from the root station 1 to the leaves. A railroad connects a station u to a station v, and has a distance d, meaning it takes d time to travel from u to v. Each station with at least one outgoing railroad has a switch that determines the child station an incoming train will be directed toward. For example, it might look like this:Initially, no trains are at any station. Train i will enter station 1 at time t_i. Every unit of time, starting at time 1, the following two steps happen:Every train has a destination station s_i. When it enters s_i, it will stop there permanently. If at some point the train is going in the wrong direction, so that it will never be able to reach s_i no matter where the switches point, it will immediately explode.Find the  if you change switches optimally, or determine that you can direct every train to its destination so that no explosion occurs. Also, find the  to achieve this.
478	Piet's Palette A sequence of primary colors (red, yellow, blue) is mixed as follows. While there are at least two colors, look at the first two. If they are distinct, replace them with the missing color. If they are the same, remove them from the sequence. In the end, if there is one color, that is the resulting color. Otherwise, if the sequence is empty, we say the resulting color is white. Here are two example mixings:Piet has a color palette with cells numbered from 1 to n. Each cell contains a primary color or is empty. Piet is very secretive, and will not share his palette with you, so you do not know what colors belong to each cell.However, he did perform k operations. There are four kinds of operations: Piet only tells you the list of operations he performs in chronological order, the indexes involved, and the resulting color of each mix operation. For each mix operation, you also know the order in which the cells are mixed. Given this information, determine the color of each cell in the initial palette. That is, you should find one possible state of the palette (before any operations were performed), or say that the described situation is impossible.
479	Puzzle Pieces You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of n\cdot m identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below.The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.
480	Card Constructions A card pyramid of height 1 is constructed by resting two cards against each other. For h>1, a card pyramid of height h is constructed by placing a card pyramid of height h-1 onto a base. A base consists of h pyramids of height 1, and h-1 cards on top. For example, card pyramids of heights 1, 2, and 3 look as follows:You start with n cards and build the tallest pyramid that you can. If there are some cards remaining, you build the tallest pyramid possible with the remaining cards. You repeat this process until it is impossible to build another pyramid. In the end, how many pyramids will you have constructed?
481	Phoenix and Balance Phoenix has n coins with weights 2^1, 2^2, \dots, 2^n. He knows that n is even.He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly \frac{n}{2} coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is . Formally, let a denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and b denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize |a-b|, the absolute value of a-b.
482	Phoenix and Beauty Phoenix loves beautiful arrays. An array is beautiful if all its subarrays of length k have the same sum. A subarray of an array is any sequence of consecutive elements.Phoenix currently has an array a of length n. He wants to insert some number of integers, possibly zero, into his array such that it becomes beautiful. The inserted integers must be between 1 and n inclusive. Integers may be inserted anywhere (even before the first or after the last element), and he is  to minimize the number of inserted integers.
483	Phoenix and Distribution Phoenix has a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. He wants to distribute all the letters of his string into k  strings a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k such that every letter of s goes to exactly one of the strings a_i. The strings a_i  need to be substrings of s. Phoenix can distribute letters of s and rearrange the letters within each string a_i however he wants.For example, if s =   and k=2, Phoenix may distribute the letters of his string in many ways, such as: But these ways are invalid: Phoenix wants to distribute the letters of his string s into k strings a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k to  the lexicographically maximum string among them, i. e. minimize max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k). Help him find the optimal distribution and print the minimal possible value of max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k).String x is lexicographically less than string y if either x is a prefix of y and x \ne y, or there exists an index i (1 \le i \le min(|x|, |y|)) such that x_i < y_i and for every j (1 \le j < i) x_j = y_j. Here |x| denotes the length of the string x.
484	Phoenix and Science Phoenix has decided to become a scientist! He is currently investigating the growth of bacteria.Initially, on day 1, there is one bacterium with mass 1.Every day, some number of bacteria will split (possibly zero or all). When a bacterium of mass m splits, it becomes two bacteria of mass \frac{m}{2} each. For example, a bacterium of mass 3 can split into two bacteria of mass 1.5.Also, every night, the mass of every bacteria will increase by one.Phoenix is wondering if it is possible for the total mass of all the bacteria to be exactly n. If it is possible, he is interested in the way to obtain that mass using the minimum possible number of nights. Help him become the best scientist!
485	Phoenix and Berries Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are n shrubs, and each shrub has a_i red berries and b_i blue berries.Each basket can contain k berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.For example, if there are two shrubs with 5 red and 2 blue berries in the first shrub and 2 red and 1 blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill 2 baskets of capacity 4 completely: Help Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can !
486	Phoenix and Memory Phoenix is trying to take a photo of his n friends with labels 1, 2, \dots, n who are lined up in a row in a special order. But before he can take the photo, his friends get distracted by a duck and mess up their order.Now, Phoenix must restore the order but he doesn't remember completely! He only remembers that the i-th friend from the left had a label between a_i and b_i inclusive. Does there exist a unique way to order his friends based of his memory? 
487	Orac and LCM For the multiset of positive integers s=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_k\}, define the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of s as follow:For example, \gcd(\{8,12\})=4,\gcd(\{12,18,6\})=6 and \textrm{lcm}(\{4,6\})=12. Note that for any positive integer x, \gcd(\{x\})=\textrm{lcm}(\{x\})=x.Orac has a sequence a with length n. He come up with the multiset t=\{\textrm{lcm}(\{a_i,a_j\})\ |\ i<j\}, and asked you to find the value of \gcd(t) for him. In other words, you need to calculate the GCD of LCMs of all pairs of elements in the given sequence.
488	Orac and Medians Slime has a sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment [l \ldots r] of this sequence and replace all values a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r to the value of median of \{a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r\}.In this problem, for the integer multiset s, the median of s is equal to the \lfloor \frac{|s|+1}{2}\rfloor-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of \{1,4,4,6,5\} is 4, and the median of \{1,7,5,8\} is 5.Slime wants Orac to make a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_n = k using these operations.Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.
489	Orac and Game of Life Orac likes games. Recently he came up with the new game, "".You should play this game on a black and white grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell is either black or white.For each iteration of the game (the initial iteration is 0), the color of each cell will change under the following rules:Two cells are adjacent if they have a mutual edge.Now Orac has set an initial situation, and he wants to know for the cell (i,j) (in i-th row and j-th column), what will be its color at the iteration p. He may ask you these questions several times. 
490	Slime and Biscuits Slime and his n friends are at a party. Slime has designed a game for his friends to play.At the beginning of the game, the i-th player has a_i biscuits. At each second, Slime will choose a biscuit randomly uniformly among all a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n biscuits, and the owner of this biscuit will give it to a random uniform player among n-1 players except himself. The game stops when one person will have all the biscuits.As the host of the party, Slime wants to know the expected value of the time that the game will last, to hold the next activity on time.For convenience, as the answer can be represented as a rational number \frac{p}{q} for coprime p and q, you need to find the value of (p \cdot q^{-1})\mod 998\,244\,353. You can prove that q\mod 998\,244\,353 \neq 0.
491	Slime and Hats Slime and Orac are holding a turn-based game. In a big room, there are n players sitting on the chairs, looking forward to a column and each of them is given a number: player 1 sits in the front of the column, player 2 sits directly behind him; player 3 sits directly behind player 2, and so on; player n sits directly behind player n-1. Each player wears a hat that is either black or white. As each player faces forward, player i knows the color of player j's hat if and only if i is larger than j.At the start of each turn, Orac will tell .After Orac speaks, if the player can uniquely identify the color of his hat, he will put his hat on the chair, stand up and leave the room. All players are smart, so if it is possible to understand the color of their hat using the obtained information during this and previous rounds, they will understand it. In each turn, all players who know the color of their hats will leave at the same time in this turn, which means a player can only leave in the next turn if he gets to know the color of his hat only after someone left the room at this turn.Note that when the player needs to leave, he will put the hat on the chair before leaving, so the players ahead of him still cannot see his hat. The i-th player will know who exactly left the room among players 1,2,\ldots,i-1, and how many players among i+1,i+2,\ldots,n have left the room.Slime stands outdoor. He watches the players walking out and records the numbers of the players and the time they get out. Unfortunately, Slime is so careless that he has only recorded some of the data, and this given data is in the format "".Slime asked you to tell him the color of each player's hat. If there are multiple solutions, you can find any of them.
492	Orac and Factors Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.For two positive integers a and b, a is a divisor of b if and only if there exists an integer c, such that a\cdot c=b.For n \ge 2, we will denote as f(n) the smallest positive divisor of n, except 1.For example, f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5.For the fixed integer n, Orac decided to add f(n) to n. For example, if he had an integer n=5, the new value of n will be equal to 10. And if he had an integer n=6, n will be changed to 8.Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.Now, for two positive integers n and k, Orac asked you to add f(n) to n exactly k times (note that n will change after each operation, so f(n) may change too) and tell him the final value of n.For example, if Orac gives you n=5 and k=2, at first you should add f(5)=5 to n=5, so your new value of n will be equal to n=10, after that, you should add f(10)=2 to 10, so your new (and the final!) value of n will be equal to 12.Orac may ask you these queries many times.
493	Orac and Models There are n models in the shop numbered from 1 to n, with sizes s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n.Orac will buy some of the models and will arrange them in the order of increasing numbers (i.e. indices, but not sizes).Orac thinks that the obtained arrangement is , if for any two adjacent models with indices i_j and i_{j+1} (note that i_j < i_{j+1}, because Orac arranged them properly), i_{j+1} is divisible by i_j and s_{i_j} < s_{i_{j+1}}.For example, for 6 models with sizes \{3, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7\}, he can buy models with indices 1, 2, and 6, and the obtained arrangement will be beautiful. Also, note that the arrangement with exactly one model is also considered beautiful.Orac wants to know the maximum number of models that he can buy, and he may ask you these queries many times.
494	Slime and Sequences (Easy Version) Slime is interested in sequences. He defined  positive integer sequences p of length n as follows:For the given integer n, the set of all good sequences of length n is s_n. For the fixed integer k and the sequence p, let f_p(k) be the number of times that k appears in p. For each k from 1 to n, Slime wants to know the following value:\left(\sum_{p\in s_n} f_p(k)\right)\ \textrm{mod}\ 998\,244\,353
495	A+B (Trial Problem) You are given two integers a and b. Print a+b.
496	Square? Vasya claims that he had a paper square. He cut it into two rectangular parts using one vertical or horizontal cut. Then Vasya informed you the dimensions of these two rectangular parts. You need to check whether Vasya originally had a square. In other words, check if it is possible to make a square using two given rectangles.
497	Skier Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters '', '', '', '' (which correspond to 1 meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively).It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is 5 seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes 1 second.Find the skier's time to roll all the path.
498	Sum of Round Numbers A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called  if it is of the form . In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive) are round.For example, the following numbers are round: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90. The following numbers are  round: 110, 707, 222, 1001.You are given a positive integer n (1 \le n \le 10^4). Represent the number n as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number n as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.
499	Same Parity Summands You are given two positive integers n (1 \le n \le 10^9) and k (1 \le k \le 100). Represent the number n as the sum of k positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by 2).In other words, find a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k such that all a_i>0, n = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k and either all a_i are even or all a_i are odd at the same time.If such a representation does not exist, then report it.
500	K-th Not Divisible by n You are given two positive integers n and k. Print the k-th positive integer that is not divisible by n.For example, if n=3, and k=7, then all numbers that are not divisible by 3 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 \dots. The 7-th number among them is 10.
501	Alice, Bob and Candies There are n candies in a row, they are numbered from left to right from 1 to n. The size of the i-th candy is a_i.Alice and Bob play an interesting and tasty game: they eat candy. Alice will eat candy , and Bob — . The game ends if all the candies are eaten.The process consists of moves. During a move, the player eats one or more sweets from her/his side (Alice eats from the left, Bob — from the right).Alice makes the first move. During the first move, she will eat 1 candy (its size is a_1). Then, each successive move the players alternate — that is, Bob makes the second move, then Alice, then again Bob and so on.On each move, a player counts the total size of candies eaten during the current move. Once this number becomes strictly greater than the total size of candies eaten by the other player on their previous move, the current player stops eating and the move ends. In other words, on a move, a player eats the smallest possible number of candies such that the sum of the sizes of candies eaten on this move is  than the sum of the sizes of candies that the other player ate on the  move. If there are not enough candies to make a move this way, then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends.For example, if n=11 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5], then:Print the number of moves in the game and two numbers:
502	Special Elements The array a=[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] (1 \le a_i \le n) is given. Its element a_i is called special if there exists a pair of indices l and r (1 \le l < r \le n) such that a_i = a_l + a_{l+1} + \ldots + a_r. In other words, an element is called special if it can be represented as the sum of  of an array (no matter if they are special or not).Print the number of special elements of the given array a.For example, if n=9 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5], then the answer is 5:Please note that some of the elements of the array a may be equal — if several elements are equal and special, then all of them should be counted in the answer.
503	Binary String Reconstruction For some binary string s (i.e. each character s_i is either '' or ''), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length 2 were written. For each pair (substring of length 2), the number of '' (ones) in it was calculated.You are given three numbers:For example, for the string s="", the following substrings would be written: "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "". Thus, n_0=1, n_1=3, n_2=5.Your task is to restore  suitable binary string s from the given values n_0, n_1, n_2. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers n_0, n_1, n_2 is greater than 0. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.
504	Most Unstable Array You are given two integers n and m. You have to construct the array a of length n consisting of  (i.e. integers greater than or equal to zero) such that the sum of elements of this array is  m and the value \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} |a_i - a_{i+1}| is the maximum possible. Recall that |x| is the absolute value of x.In other words, you have to maximize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent (consecutive) elements. For example, if the array a=[1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 0] then the value above for this array is |1-3| + |3-2| + |2-5| + |5-5| + |5-0| = 2 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 11. Note that this example  but it shows how the required value for some array is calculated.You have to answer t independent test cases.
505	Two Arrays And Swaps You are given two arrays a and b both consisting of n positive (greater than zero) integers. You are also given an integer k.In one move, you can choose two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n) and swap a_i and b_j (i.e. a_i becomes b_j and vice versa). Note that i and j can be equal or different (in particular, swap a_2 with b_2 or swap a_3 and b_9 both are acceptable moves).Your task is to find the  possible sum you can obtain in the array a if you can do no more than (i.e. at most) k such moves (swaps).You have to answer t independent test cases.
506	Board Moves You are given a board of size n \times n, where n is  (not divisible by 2). Initially, each cell of the board contains one figure.In one move, you can select  presented in some cell and move it to one of the cells , i.e. from the cell (i, j) you can move the figure to cells: Of course, you  move figures to cells out of the board. It is allowed that after a move there will be several figures in one cell.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to get  into  cell (i.e. n^2-1 cells should contain 0 figures and one cell should contain n^2 figures).You have to answer t independent test cases.
507	Constructing the Array You are given an array a of length n consisting of zeros. You perform n actions with this array: during the i-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:Consider the array a of length 5 (initially a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). Then it changes as follows:Your task is to find the array a of length n after performing all n actions. .You have to answer t independent test cases.
508	K-periodic Garland You are given a garland consisting of n lamps. States of the lamps are represented by the string s of length n. The i-th character of the string s_i equals '' if the i-th lamp is turned off or '' if the i-th lamp is turned on. You are also given a positive integer k.In one move, you can choose  and change its state (i.e. turn it on if it is turned off and vice versa).The garland is called k-periodic if the distance between  is  k. Consider the case k=3. Then garlands "", "", "" and "" are good but garlands "", "" and "" are not. Note that , i.e. the first turned on lamp is not going after the last turned on lamp and vice versa.Your task is to find the  number of moves you need to make to obtain k-periodic garland from the given one.You have to answer t independent test cases.
509	Decreasing Heights You are playing one famous sandbox game with the three-dimensional world. The map of the world can be represented as a matrix of size n \times m, where the height of the cell (i, j) is a_{i, j}.You are in the cell (1, 1) right now and want to get in the cell (n, m). You can move only down (from the cell (i, j) to the cell (i + 1, j)) or right (from the cell (i, j) to the cell (i, j + 1)). There is an additional : if the height of the current cell is x then you can move only to the cell with height x+1. you can perform several operations. During one operation, you can decrease the height of  cell by one. I.e. you choose some cell (i, j) and assign (set) a_{i, j} := a_{i, j} - 1. Note that you  make heights . Also note that you  decrease the height of the cell (1, 1).Your task is to find the  number of operations you have to perform to obtain at least one suitable path from the cell (1, 1) to the cell (n, m). It is guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer t independent test cases.
510	Alarm Clock Polycarp has spent the entire day preparing problems for you. Now he has to sleep for at least a minutes to feel refreshed. So he has just fallen asleep and his first alarm goes off in b minutes.Every time Polycarp wakes up, he decides if he wants to sleep for some more time or not. If he's slept for less than a minutes in total, then he sets his alarm to go off in c minutes after it is reset and spends d minutes to fall asleep again. Otherwise, he gets out of his bed and proceeds with the day.If the alarm goes off while Polycarp is falling asleep, then he resets his alarm to go off in another c minutes and tries to fall asleep for d minutes again.You just want to find out when will Polycarp get out of his bed or report that it will never happen.
511	Ternary String You are given a string s such that each its character is either , , or . You have to choose the shortest contiguous substring of s such that it contains each of these three characters at least once.A contiguous substring of string s is a string that can be obtained from s by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of s and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of s.
512	Multiset You are given a multiset consisting of n integers. You have to process queries of two types:k-th order statistics in the multiset is the k-th element in the sorted list of all elements of the multiset. For example, if the multiset contains elements 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, and k = 3, then you have to find the 3-rd element in [1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 7], which is 2. If you try to delete an element which occurs multiple times in the multiset, only one occurence is removed. After processing all queries, print  number belonging to the multiset, or say that it is empty.
513	Graph Coloring You are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of n vertices and m edges. Also you are given three integers n_1, n_2 and n_3.Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers ,  or  in such way, that: If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.
514	Summoning Minions Polycarp plays a computer game. In this game, the players summon armies of magical minions, which then fight each other.Polycarp can summon n different minions. The initial power level of the i-th minion is a_i, and when it is summoned, all previously summoned minions' power levels are increased by b_i. The minions can be summoned in any order.Unfortunately, Polycarp cannot have more than k minions under his control. To get rid of unwanted minions after summoning them, he may destroy them. Each minion can be summoned (and destroyed) only once.Polycarp's goal is to summon the strongest possible army. Formally, he wants to maximize the sum of power levels of all minions under his control (those which are summoned and not destroyed).Help Polycarp to make up a plan of actions to summon the strongest possible army!
515	Sequence with Digits Let's define the following recurrence: a_{n+1} = a_{n} + minDigit(a_{n}) \cdot maxDigit(a_{n}).Here minDigit(x) and maxDigit(x) are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of x without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes.Your task is calculate a_{K} for given a_{1} and K.
516	Young Explorers Young wilderness explorers set off to their first expedition led by senior explorer Russell. Explorers went into a forest, set up a camp and decided to split into groups to explore as much interesting locations as possible. Russell was trying to form groups, but ran into some difficulties...Most of the young explorers are inexperienced, and sending them alone would be a mistake. Even Russell himself became senior explorer not long ago. Each of young explorers has a positive integer parameter e_i — his inexperience. Russell decided that an explorer with inexperience e can only join the group of e or more people.Now Russell needs to figure out how many groups he can organize. It's not necessary to include every explorer in one of the groups: some can stay in the camp. Russell is worried about this expedition, so he asked you to help him.
517	Count Triangles Like any unknown mathematician, Yuri has favourite numbers: A, B, C, and D, where A \leq B \leq C \leq D. Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides x, y, and z exist, such that A \leq x \leq B \leq y \leq C \leq z \leq D holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.
518	Game With Array Petya and Vasya are competing with each other in a new interesting game as they always do.At the beginning of the game Petya has to come up with an array of N positive integers. Sum of all elements in his array should be equal to S. Then Petya has to select an integer K such that 0 \leq K \leq S.In order to win, Vasya has to find a non-empty subarray in Petya's array such that the sum of all selected elements equals to either K or S - K. Otherwise Vasya loses.You are given integers N and S. You should determine if Petya can win, considering Vasya plays optimally. If Petya can win, help him to do that.
519	Restorer Distance You have to restore the wall. The wall consists of N pillars of bricks, the height of the i-th pillar is initially equal to h_{i}, the height is measured in number of bricks. After the restoration all the N pillars should have equal heights.You are allowed the following operations:You cannot create additional pillars or ignore some of pre-existing pillars even if their height becomes 0.What is the minimal total cost of restoration, in other words, what is the minimal total cost to make all the pillars of equal height?
520	Guess Divisors Count We have hidden an integer 1 \le X \le 10^{9}. You  guess this number. You have to  of this number, and you : your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is not greater than 7  its relative error is not greater than 0.5. More formally, let your answer be ans and the number of divisors of X be d, then your answer will be considered correct if  of the two following conditions is true:You can make at most 22 queries. One query consists of one integer 1 \le Q \le 10^{18}. In response, you will get gcd(X, Q) — the greatest common divisor of X and Q.The number X is fixed before all queries. In other words, .Let's call the process of guessing the number of divisors of number X a . In one test you will have to play T independent games, that is, guess the number of divisors T times for T independent values of X.
521	Park Lighting Due to the coronavirus pandemic, city authorities obligated citizens to keep a social distance. The mayor of the city Semyon wants to light up Gluharniki park so that people could see each other even at night to keep the social distance.The park is a rectangular table with n rows and m columns, where the cells of the table are squares, and the boundaries between the cells are streets. External borders are also streets. Every street has length 1. For example, park with n=m=2 has 12 streets.You were assigned to develop a plan for lighting the park. You can put lanterns in the middle of the streets. The lamp lights two squares near it (or only one square if it stands on the border of the park).Semyon wants to spend the least possible amount of money on lighting but also wants people throughout the park to keep a social distance. So he asks you to find the minimum number of lanterns that are required to light all the squares.
522	Maria Breaks the Self-isolation Maria is the most active old lady in her house. She was tired of sitting at home. She decided to organize a ceremony against the coronavirus.She has n friends who are also grannies (Maria is not included in this number). The i-th granny is ready to attend the ceremony, provided that at the time of her appearance in the courtyard there will be at least a_i other grannies there. Note that grannies can come into the courtyard at the same time. Formally, the granny i agrees to come if the number of other grannies who came earlier or at the same time with her is greater than or equal to a_i.Grannies gather in the courtyard like that.Your task is to find what maximum number of grannies (including herself) Maria can collect in the courtyard for the ceremony. After all, the more people in one place during quarantine, the more effective the ceremony!Consider an example: if n=6 and a=[1,5,4,5,1,9], then:
523	Celex Update During the quarantine, Sicromoft has more free time to create the new functions in "". The developers made a new function , which infinitely fills an infinite table to the right and down from the upper left corner as follows:The developers of the  function don't sleep either. Because of the boredom, they teamed up with the developers of the  function, so they added the ability to calculate the sum on an arbitrary path from one cell to another, moving down or right. Formally, from the cell (x,y) in one step you can move to the cell (x+1, y) or (x, y+1). After another Dinwows update, Levian started to study "" (because he wants to be an accountant!). After filling in the table with the  function, he asked you to calculate the quantity of possible different amounts on the path from a given cell (x_1, y_1) to another given cell (x_2, y_2), if you can only move one cell down or right.Formally, consider all the paths from the cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) such that each next cell in the path is located either to the down or to the right of the previous one. Calculate the number of different sums of elements for all such paths.
524	The Best Vacation You've been in love with Coronavirus-chan for a long time, but you didn't know where she lived until now. And just now you found out that she lives in a faraway place called Naha. You immediately decided to take a vacation and visit Coronavirus-chan. Your vacation lasts exactly x days and that's the exact number of days you will spend visiting your friend. You will spend exactly x consecutive (successive) days visiting Coronavirus-chan.They use a very unusual calendar in Naha: there are n months in a year, i-th month lasts exactly d_i days. Days in the i-th month are numbered from 1 to d_i. There are no leap years in Naha.The mood of Coronavirus-chan (and, accordingly, her desire to hug you) depends on the number of the day in a month. In particular, you get j hugs if you visit Coronavirus-chan on the j-th day of the month.You know about this feature of your friend and want to plan your trip to get as many hugs as possible (and then maybe you can win the heart of Coronavirus-chan). Please note that your trip should  begin and end in the same year.
525	Are You Fired? Levian works as an accountant in a large company. Levian knows how much the company has earned in each of the n consecutive months — in the i-th month the company had income equal to a_i (positive income means profit, negative income means loss, zero income means no change). Because of the general self-isolation, the first \lceil \tfrac{n}{2} \rceil months income might have been completely unstable, but then everything stabilized and for the last \lfloor \tfrac{n}{2} \rfloor months .Levian decided to tell the directors n-k+1 numbers — the total income of the company for each k consecutive months. In other words, for each i between 1 and n-k+1 he will say the value a_i + a_{i+1} + \ldots + a_{i + k - 1}. For example, if a=[-1, 0, 1, 2, 2] and k=3 he will say the numbers 0, 3, 5.Unfortunately, if at least one total income reported by Levian is not a profit (income \le 0), the directors will get angry and fire the failed accountant.Save Levian's career: find any such k, that for each k months in a row the company had made a profit, or report that it is impossible.
526	Tasty Cookie Oh, no!The coronavirus has caught you, and now you're sitting in a dark cellar, with tied legs (but not hands). You have a delicious cookie, a laptop in front of you, and your ideal development environment is open. The coronavirus convinces you to solve the following problem.You are given two arrays A and B of size n. You can do operations of two types with array A: You need to understand if you can get an array B from the array A. If it is possible, you will have to restore the order of these operations by minimizing the number of operations of the second type. Fortunately, the coronavirus is good today, so he has allowed you not to restore actions if the minimum number of second type operations is more than 2\cdot 10^5. But coronavirus resents you, so if you restore the answer, the total number of operations should not exceed 5\cdot 10^5.Solve this problem and get the cookie, or the coronavirus will extend the quarantine for five years and make the whole economy collapse! 
527	Berland Poker The game of Berland poker is played with a deck of n cards, m of which are jokers. k players play this game (n is divisible by k).At the beginning of the game, each player takes \frac{n}{k} cards from the deck (so each card is taken by exactly one player). The player who has the maximum number of jokers is the winner, and he gets the number of points equal to x - y, where x is the number of jokers in the winner's hand, and y is the maximum number of jokers among all other players. If there are two or more players with maximum number of jokers, all of them are winners and they get 0 points.Here are some examples:Given n, m and k, calculate the maximum number of points a player can get for winning the game.
528	New Theatre Square You might have remembered Theatre square from the . Now it's finally getting repaved.The square still has a rectangular shape of n \times m meters. However, the picture is about to get more complicated now. Let a_{i,j} be the j-th square in the i-th row of the pavement.You are given the picture of the squares:The black squares are paved already. You have to pave the white squares. There are two options for pavement tiles:What is the smallest total price of the tiles needed to cover all the white squares?
529	Mixing Water There are two infinite sources of water:You perform the following procedure of alternating moves:.The barrel is initially empty. You have to pour  into the barrel. The water temperature in the barrel is an average of the temperatures of the poured cups.You want to achieve a temperature as close as possible to t. So if the temperature in the barrel is t_b, then the  of t_b and t (|t_b - t|) should be as small as possible.How many cups should you pour into the barrel, so that the temperature in it is as close as possible to t? If there are multiple answers with the minimum absolute difference, then print the smallest of them.
530	Yet Another Yet Another Task Alice and Bob are playing yet another card game. This time the rules are the following. There are n cards lying in a row in front of them. The i-th card has value a_i. First, Alice chooses a non-empty consecutive segment of cards [l; r] (l \le r). After that Bob removes a single card j from that segment (l \le j \le r). The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment (a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{j - 1} + a_{j + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r). In particular, if Alice chooses a segment with just one element, then the score after Bob removes the only card is 0.Alice wants to make the score as big as possible. Bob takes such a card that the score is as small as possible.What segment should Alice choose so that the score is maximum possible? Output the maximum score.
531	Modular Stability We define x \bmod y as the remainder of division of x by y (\% operator in C++ or Java,  operator in Pascal).Let's call an array of positive integers [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k]  if for every permutation p of integers from 1 to k, and for every non-negative integer x, the following condition is met:That is, for each non-negative integer x, the value of (((x \bmod a_1) \bmod a_2) \dots \bmod a_{k - 1}) \bmod a_k does not change if we reorder the elements of the array a.For two given integers n and k, calculate the number of  arrays [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k] such that 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_k \le n.
532	RC Kaboom Show You know, it's hard to conduct a show with lots of participants and spectators at the same place nowadays. Still, you are not giving up on your dream to make a car crash showcase! You decided to replace the real cars with remote controlled ones, call the event "Remote Control Kaboom Show" and stream everything online.For the preparation you arranged an arena — an infinite 2D-field. You also bought n remote controlled cars and set them up on the arena. Unfortunately, the cars you bought can only go forward without turning left, right or around. So you additionally put the cars in the direction you want them to go.To be formal, for each car i (1 \le i \le n) you chose its initial position (x_i, y_i) and a direction vector (dx_i, dy_i). Moreover, each car has a constant speed s_i units per second. So after car i is launched, it stars moving from (x_i, y_i) in the direction (dx_i, dy_i) with constant speed s_i.The goal of the show is to create a car collision as fast as possible! You noted that launching every car at the beginning of the show often fails to produce any collisions at all. Thus, you plan to launch the i-th car at some moment t_i.  Note that it's not necessary for t_i to be integer and t_i is allowed to be equal to t_j for any i, j.The show starts at time 0. The show ends when two cars i and j (i \ne j) collide (i. e. come to the same coordinate at the same time). The duration of the show is the time between the start and the end.What's the fastest crash you can arrange by choosing all t_i? If it's possible to arrange a crash then print the shortest possible duration of the show. Otherwise, report that it's impossible.
533	Minimal Square Find the minimum area of a  land on which you can place two identical rectangular a \times b houses. The sides of the houses should be parallel to the sides of the desired square land.Formally, Two rectangles can touch each other (side or corner), but cannot intersect. Rectangles can also touch the sides of the square but must be completely inside it. You can rotate the rectangles. Take a look at the examples for a better understanding.
534	Honest Coach There are n athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete — the athlete number i has the strength s_i.You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team.You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams A and B so that the value |\max(A) - \min(B)| is as small as possible, where \max(A) is the maximum strength of an athlete from team A, and \min(B) is the minimum strength of an athlete from team B.For example, if n=5 and the strength of the athletes is s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4], then one of the possible split into teams is: In this case, the value |\max(A) - \min(B)| will be equal to |4-3|=1. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams.Print the minimum value |\max(A) - \min(B)|.
535	Similar Pairs We call two numbers x and y  if they have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by 2), or if |x-y|=1. For example, in each of the pairs (2, 6), (4, 3), (11, 7), the numbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs (1, 4), (3, 12), they are not.You are given an array a of n (n is even) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.For example, for the array a = [11, 14, 16, 12], there is a partition into pairs (11, 12) and (14, 16). The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ by one, and in the second pair because they are both even.
536	Buying Shovels Polycarp wants to buy  n shovels. The shop sells packages with shovels. The store has k types of packages: the package of the i-th type consists of exactly i shovels (1 \le i \le k). The store has an infinite number of packages of each type.Polycarp wants to choose  type of packages and then buy several (one or more) packages of this type. What is the smallest number of packages Polycarp will have to buy to get exactly n shovels?For example, if n=8 and k=7, then Polycarp will buy 2 packages of 4 shovels.Help Polycarp find the minimum number of packages that he needs to buy, given that he: 
537	Polygon Polygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side n, initially filled with the character .On the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly 2n cannons were placed.Cannons shoot character . At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a  flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another . After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a look at the examples for better understanding.More formally: For example, consider the following sequence of shots:  You have a report from the military training on your desk. This report is a square matrix with side length n consisting of  and . You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains .
538	Spy-string You are given n strings a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n: all of them have the same length m. The strings consist of lowercase English letters.Find any string s of length m such that each of the given n strings differs from s in at most one position. Formally, for each given string a_i, there is no more than one position j such that a_i[j] \ne s[j].Note that the desired string s may be equal to one of the given strings a_i, or it may differ from all the given strings.For example, if you have the strings  and , then the answer to the problem might be the string , which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.
539	Johnny and Contribution Today Johnny wants to increase his contribution. His plan assumes writing n blogs. One blog covers one topic, but one topic can be covered by many blogs. Moreover, some blogs have references to each other. Each pair of blogs that are connected by a reference has to cover different topics because otherwise, the readers can notice that they are split just for more contribution. Set of blogs and bidirectional references between some pairs of them is called blogs network.There are n different topics, numbered from 1 to n sorted by Johnny's knowledge. The structure of the blogs network is already prepared. Now Johnny has to write the blogs in some order. He is lazy, so each time before writing a blog, he looks at it's already written neighbors (the blogs referenced to current one) and chooses the topic with the smallest number which is not covered by neighbors. It's easy to see that this strategy will always allow him to choose a topic because there are at most n - 1 neighbors.For example, if already written neighbors of the current blog have topics number 1, 3, 1, 5, and 2, Johnny will choose the topic number 4 for the current blog, because topics number 1, 2 and 3 are already covered by neighbors and topic number 4 isn't covered.As a good friend, you have done some research and predicted the best topic for each blog. Can you tell Johnny, in which order he has to write the blogs, so that his strategy produces the topic assignment chosen by you?
540	Johnny and Grandmaster Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: "". The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems. The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked p^{k_i} problems from i-th category (p is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced.Formally, given n numbers p^{k_i}, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo 10^{9}+7.
541	Johnny and Megan's Necklace Johnny's younger sister Megan had a birthday recently. Her brother has bought her a box signed as "". It contains many necklace parts and some magic glue. The necklace part is a chain connecting two pearls. Color of each pearl can be defined by a non-negative integer. The magic glue allows Megan to merge two pearls (possibly from the same necklace part) into one. The beauty of a connection of pearls in colors u and v is defined as follows: let 2^k be the greatest power of two dividing u \oplus v —  of u and v. Then the beauty equals k. If u = v, you may assume that beauty is equal to 20.Each pearl can be combined with another at most once. Merging two parts of a necklace connects them. Using the glue multiple times, Megan can finally build the necklace, which is a cycle made from connected necklace parts (so every pearl in the necklace is combined with precisely one other pearl in it). The beauty of such a necklace is the minimum beauty of a single connection in it. The girl wants to use all available necklace parts to build  necklace consisting of  with the largest possible beauty. Help her!
542	Johnny and James James Bond, Johnny's favorite secret agent, has a new mission. There are n enemy bases, each of them is described by its coordinates so that we can think about them as points in the Cartesian plane. The bases can communicate with each other, sending a signal, which is the ray directed from the chosen point to the origin or in the opposite direction. The exception is the central base, which lies at the origin and can send a signal in any direction. When some two bases want to communicate, there are two possible scenarios. If they lie on the same line with the origin, one of them can send a signal directly to the other one. Otherwise, the signal is sent from the first base to the central, and then the central sends it to the second base. We denote the distance between two bases as the total Euclidean distance that a signal sent between them has to travel.Bond can damage all but some k bases, which he can choose arbitrarily. A damaged base can't send or receive the direct signal but still can pass it between two working bases. In particular, James can damage the central base, and the signal  between any two undamaged bases as before, so the distance between them remains the same. What is the maximal sum of the distances between all pairs of remaining bases that 007 can achieve by damaging exactly n - k of them?
543	James and the Chase James Bond has a new plan for catching his enemy. There are some cities and  roads between them, such that it is possible to travel between any two cities using these roads. When the enemy appears in some city, Bond knows her next destination but has no idea which path she will choose to move there. The city a is called interesting, if for each city b, there is exactly one simple path from a to b. By a simple path, we understand a sequence of distinct cities, such that for every two neighboring cities, there exists a directed road from the first to the second city. Bond's enemy is the mistress of escapes, so only the chase started in an interesting city gives the possibility of catching her. James wants to arrange his people in such cities. However, if there are not enough interesting cities, the whole action doesn't make sense since Bond's people may wait too long for the enemy.You are responsible for finding all the interesting cities or saying that there is not enough of them. By not enough, James means strictly less than 20\% of all cities. 
544	Johnny and New Toy Johnny has a new toy. As you may guess, it is a little bit extraordinary. The toy is a permutation P of numbers from 1 to n, written in one row next to each other. For each i from 1 to n - 1 between P_i and P_{i + 1} there is a weight W_i written, and those weights form a permutation of numbers from 1 to n - 1. There are also extra weights W_0 = W_n = 0.The instruction defines subsegment [L, R] as good if W_{L - 1} < W_i and W_R < W_i for any i in \{L, L + 1, \ldots, R - 1\}. For such subsegment it also defines W_M as minimum of set \{W_L, W_{L + 1}, \ldots, W_{R - 1}\}. Now the fun begins. In one move, the player can choose one of the good subsegments, cut it into [L, M] and [M + 1, R] and swap the two parts. More precisely, before one move the chosen subsegment of our toy looks like: W_{L - 1}, P_L, W_L, \ldots, W_{M - 1}, P_M, W_M, P_{M + 1}, W_{M + 1}, \ldots, W_{R - 1}, P_R, W_R and afterwards it looks like this: W_{L - 1}, P_{M + 1}, W_{M + 1}, \ldots, W_{R - 1}, P_R, W_M, P_L, W_L, \ldots, W_{M - 1}, P_M, W_R Such a move can be performed multiple times (possibly zero), and the goal is to achieve the minimum number of inversions in P. Johnny's younger sister Megan thinks that the rules are too complicated, so she wants to test her brother by choosing some pair of indices X and Y, and swapping P_X and P_Y (X might be equal Y). After each sister's swap, Johnny wonders, what is the minimal number of inversions that he can achieve, starting with current P and making legal moves?You can assume that the input is generated . P and W were chosen independently and equiprobably over all permutations; also, Megan's requests were chosen independently and equiprobably over all pairs of indices.
545	Johnny and Ancient Computer Johnny has recently found an ancient, broken computer. The machine has only one register, which allows one to put in there one variable. Then in one operation, you can shift its bits left or right by at most three positions. The right shift is forbidden if it . So, in fact, in one operation, you can multiply or divide your number by 2, 4 or 8, and division is only allowed if the number is divisible by the chosen divisor. Formally, if the register contains a positive integer x, in one operation it can be replaced by one of the following: For example, if x = 6, in one operation it can be replaced by 12, 24, 48 or 3. Value 6 isn't divisible by 4 or 8, so there're only four variants of replacement.Now Johnny wonders how many operations he needs to perform if he puts a in the register and wants to get b at the end.
546	Johnny and His Hobbies Among Johnny's numerous hobbies, there are two seemingly harmless ones: applying bitwise operations and sneaking into his dad's office. As it is usually the case with small children, Johnny is unaware that combining these two activities can get him in a lot of trouble.There is a set S containing very important numbers on his dad's desk. The minute Johnny heard about it, he decided that it's a good idea to choose a  integer k and replace each element s of the set S with s \oplus k (\oplus denotes the  operation). Help him choose such k that Johnny's dad will not see any difference after his son is done playing (i.e. Johnny will get the same set as before playing). It is possible that no such number exists. It is also possible that there are many of them. In such a case, output the smallest one. Note that the order of elements in a set doesn't matter, i.e. set \{1, 2, 3\} equals to set \{2, 1, 3\}.Formally, find the smallest positive integer k such that \{s \oplus k | s \in S\} = S or report that there is no such number.For example, if S = \{1, 3, 4\} and k = 2, new set will be equal to \{3, 1, 6\}. If S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} and k = 1, after playing set will stay the same.
547	Johnny and Another Rating Drop The last contest held on Johnny's favorite competitive programming platform has been received rather positively. However, Johnny's rating has dropped again! He thinks that the presented tasks are lovely, but don't show the truth about competitors' skills.The boy is now looking at the ratings of consecutive participants written in a binary system. He thinks that the more such ratings differ, the more unfair is that such people are next to each other. He defines the difference between two numbers as the number of bit positions, where one number has zero, and another has one (we suppose that numbers are padded with leading zeros to the same length). For example, the difference of 5 = 101_2 and 14 = 1110_2 equals to 3, since 0101 and 1110 differ in 3 positions. Johnny defines the unfairness of the contest as the sum of such differences counted for neighboring participants.Johnny has just sent you the rating sequence and wants you to find the unfairness of the competition. You have noticed that you've got a sequence of  integers from 0 to n. That's strange, but the boy stubbornly says that everything is right. So help him and find the desired unfairness for received numbers.
548	Odd Selection Shubham has an array a of size n, and wants to select exactly x elements from it, such that their sum is odd. These elements do not have to be consecutive. The elements of the array are not guaranteed to be distinct.Tell him whether he can do so.
549	Subsequence Hate Shubham has a binary string s. A binary string is a string containing only characters "" and "".He can perform the following operation on the string any amount of times: A string is called good if it does not contain "" or "" as a subsequence  — for instance, "" contains "" as a subsequence, hence it is not a good string, while "" doesn't contain neither "" nor "" as subsequences, so it is a good string.What is the minimum number of operations he will have to perform, so that the string becomes good? It can be shown that with these operations we can make any string good.A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
550	Game On Leaves Ayush and Ashish play a game on an unrooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 1 to n. Players make the following move in turns: A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.There is a special node numbered x. The player who removes this node wins the game. Ayush moves first. Determine the winner of the game if each player plays optimally.
551	Guess The Maximums Ayush devised a new scheme to set the password of his lock. The lock has k slots where each slot can hold integers from 1 to n. The password P is a sequence of k integers each in the range [1, n], i-th element of which goes into the i-th slot of the lock.To set the password of his lock, Ayush comes up with an array A of n integers each in the range [1, n] (not necessarily distinct). He then picks k  subsets of indices S_1, S_2, ..., S_k (S_i \underset{i \neq j} \cap S_j = \emptyset) and sets his password as P_i = \max\limits_{j \notin S_i} A[j]. In other words, the i-th integer in the password is equal to the maximum over all elements of A whose indices do not belong to S_i.You are given the subsets of indices chosen by Ayush. You need to guess the password. To make a query, you can choose a non-empty subset of indices of the array and ask the maximum of all elements of the array with index in this subset. .
552	Tree Shuffling Ashish has a tree consisting of n nodes numbered 1 to n rooted at node 1. The i-th node in the tree has a cost a_i, and binary digit b_i is written in it. He wants to have binary digit c_i written in the i-th node in the end.To achieve this, he can perform the following operation any number of times: He wants to perform the operations in such a way that every node finally has the digit corresponding to its target.Help him find the minimum total cost he needs to spend so that after all the operations, every node u has digit c_u written in it, or determine that it is impossible.
553	Rotating Substrings You are given two strings s and t, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin alphabets. You want to make s equal to t. You can perform the following operation on s any number of times to achieve it — For example, on rotating the substring [2,4] , string "" becomes "". A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.Find the minimum number of operations required to convert s to t, or determine that it's impossible.
554	XXXXX Ehab loves number theory, but for some reason he hates the number x. Given an array a, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elements  divisible by x, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist.An array a is a subarray of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
555	Most socially-distanced subsequence Given a permutation p of length n, find its subsequence s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k of length at least 2 such that:If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements.A permutation of length n is an array of length n in which every element from 1 to n occurs exactly once.
556	Ehab and Prefix MEXs Given an array a of length n, find another array, b, of length n such that:The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't belong to this set.If such array doesn't exist, determine this.
557	Ehab's Last Corollary Given a connected undirected graph with n vertices and an integer k, you have to either:An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof that for any input you can always solve at least one of these problems, but it's left as an exercise for the reader.
558	X-OR Ehab has a hidden permutation p of length n consisting of the elements from 0 to n-1. You, for some reason, want to figure out the permutation. To do that, you can give Ehab 2  indices i and j, and he'll reply with (p_i|p_j) where | is the  operation.Ehab has just enough free time to answer 4269 questions, and while he's OK with answering that many questions, he's too lazy to play your silly games, so he'll fix the permutation beforehand and will  change it depending on your queries. Can you guess the permutation?
559	Matrix Game Ashish and Vivek play a game on a matrix consisting of n rows and m columns, where they take turns claiming cells. Unclaimed cells are represented by 0, while claimed cells are represented by 1. The initial state of the matrix is given. There can be some claimed cells in the initial state.In each turn, a player must claim a cell. A cell may be claimed if it is unclaimed and does not share a row or column with any other already claimed cells. When a player is unable to make a move, he loses and the game ends.If Ashish and Vivek take turns to move and Ashish goes first, determine the winner of the game if both of them are playing optimally.Optimal play between two players means that both players choose the best possible strategy to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves.
560	Trouble Sort Ashish has n elements arranged in a line. These elements are represented by two integers a_i — the value of the element and b_i — the type of the element (there are only two possible types: 0 and 1). He wants to sort the elements in non-decreasing values of a_i.He can perform the following operation any number of times: Tell him if he can sort the elements in non-decreasing values of a_i after performing any number of operations.
561	Rotation Matching After the mysterious disappearance of Ashish, his two favourite disciples Ishika and Hriday, were each left with one half of a secret message. These messages can each be represented by a permutation of size n. Let's call them a and b.Note that a permutation of n elements is a sequence of numbers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, in which every number from 1 to n appears exactly once. The message can be decoded by an arrangement of sequence a and b, such that the number of matching pairs of elements between them is maximum. A pair of elements a_i and b_j is said to match if: His two disciples are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times: A single cyclic shift to the left on any permutation c is an operation that sets c_1:=c_2, c_2:=c_3, \ldots, c_n:=c_1 simultaneously. Likewise, a single cyclic shift to the right on any permutation c is an operation that sets c_1:=c_n, c_2:=c_1, \ldots, c_n:=c_{n-1} simultaneously.Help Ishika and Hriday find the maximum number of pairs of elements that match after performing the operation any (possibly zero) number of times.
562	Solve The Maze Vivek has encountered a problem. He has a maze that can be represented as an n \times m grid. Each of the grid cells may represent the following:The only escape from the maze is at cell (n, m).A person can move to a cell only if it shares a side with their current cell and does not contain a wall. Vivek wants to block some of the empty cells by replacing them with walls in such a way, that all the good people are able to escape, while none of the bad people are able to. A cell that initially contains '' or ''  and .Help him determine if there exists a way to replace some (zero or more) empty cells with walls to satisfy the above conditions. Vivek can also block this cell.
563	Maximum Subsequence Value Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array a of size n consisting of positive integers. The value of a non-empty subsequence of k elements of a is defined as \sum 2^i over all integers i \ge 0 such that at least \max(1, k - 2) elements of the subsequence have the i-th bit set in their binary representation (value x has the i-th bit set in its binary representation if \lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \rfloor \mod 2 is equal to 1). Recall that b is a subsequence of a, if b can be obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from a.Help Ashish find the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of a.
564	Swaps Again Ayush, Ashish and Vivek are busy preparing a new problem for the next Codeforces round and need help checking if their test cases are valid.Each test case consists of an integer n and two arrays a and b, of size n. If after some (possibly zero) operations described below, array a can be transformed into array b, the input is said to be . Otherwise, it is .An operation on array a is: For example, if array a initially is \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, after performing an operation with k = 2, it is transformed into \{5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2\}.Given the set of test cases, help them determine if each one is  or .
565	Shovels and Swords Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has a sticks and b diamonds?
566	Shuffle You are given an array consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Initially a_x = 1, all other elements are equal to 0.You have to perform m operations. During the i-th operation, you choose two indices c and d such that l_i \le c, d \le r_i, and swap a_c and a_d.Calculate the number of indices k such that it is possible to choose the operations so that a_k = 1 in the end.
567	Palindromic Paths You are given a matrix with n rows (numbered from 1 to n) and m columns (numbered from 1 to m). A number a_{i, j} is written in the cell belonging to the i-th row and the j-th column, each number is either 0 or 1.A chip is initially in the cell (1, 1), and it will be moved to the cell (n, m). During each move, it either moves to the next cell in the current row, or in the current column (if the current cell is (x, y), then after the move it can be either (x + 1, y) or (x, y + 1)). The chip cannot leave the matrix.Consider each path of the chip from (1, 1) to (n, m). A path is called  if the number in the first cell is equal to the number in the last cell, the number in the second cell is equal to the number in the second-to-last cell, and so on.Your goal is to change the values in the minimum number of cells so that  path is .
568	Two Divisors You are given n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.For each a_i find its  d_1 > 1 and d_2 > 1 such that \gcd(d_1 + d_2, a_i) = 1 (where \gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b) or say that there is no such pair.
569	Two Arrays You are given two arrays a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n and b_1, b_2, \dots , b_m. Array b is sorted in ascending order (b_i < b_{i + 1} for each i from 1 to m - 1).You have to divide the array a into m consecutive subarrays so that, for each i from 1 to m, the minimum on the i-th subarray is equal to b_i. Note that each element belongs to exactly one subarray, and they are formed in such a way: the first several elements of a compose the first subarray, the next several elements of a compose the second subarray, and so on.For example, if a = [12, 10, 20, 20, 25, 30] and b = [10, 20, 30] then there are two good partitions of array a: You have to calculate the number of ways to divide the array a. Since the number can be pretty large print it modulo .
570	Jog Around The Graph You are given a simple weighted connected undirected graph, consisting of n vertices and m edges.A path in the graph of length k is a sequence of k+1 vertices v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{k+1} such that for each i (1 \le i \le k) the edge (v_i, v_{i+1}) is present in the graph. A path from some vertex v also has vertex v_1=v. Note that edges and vertices are allowed to be included in the path multiple times.The weight of the path is the total weight of edges in it.For each i from 1 to q consider a path from vertex 1 of length i of the maximum weight. What is the sum of weights of these q paths?Answer can be quite large, so print it modulo 10^9+7.
571	Short Substrings Alice guesses the strings that Bob made for her.At first, Bob came up with the secret string a consisting of lowercase English letters. The string a has a length of 2 or more characters. Then, from string a he builds a new string b and offers Alice the string b so that she can guess the string a.Bob builds b from a as follows: he writes all the substrings of length 2 of the string a in the order from left to right, and then joins them in the same order into the string b.For example, if Bob came up with the string a="", then all the substrings of length 2 of the string a are: "", "", "". Therefore, the string b="".You are given the string b. Help Alice to guess the string a that Bob came up with. It is guaranteed that b was built according to the algorithm given above. It can be proved that the answer to the problem is unique.
572	Even Array You are given an array a[0 \ldots n-1] of length n which consists of non-negative integers. An array is called  if the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index. More formally, an array is good if for all i (0 \le i \le n - 1) the equality i \bmod 2 = a[i] \bmod 2 holds, where x \bmod 2 is the remainder of dividing x by 2.For example, the arrays [0, 5, 2, 1] and [0, 17, 0, 3] are good, and the array [2, 4, 6, 7] is bad, because for i=1, the parities of i and a[i] are different: i \bmod 2 = 1 \bmod 2 = 1, but a[i] \bmod 2 = 4 \bmod 2 = 0.In one move, you can take  two elements of the array and swap them (these elements are not necessarily adjacent).Find the minimum number of moves in which you can make the array a good, or say that this is not possible.
573	Social Distance Polycarp and his friends want to visit a new restaurant. The restaurant has n tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from 1 to n in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length n which contains characters "" (the table is occupied) and "" (the table is empty).Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of k or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number i, then all tables with numbers from i-k to i+k (except for the i-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than k.For example, if n=8 and k=2, then:In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without "" or a string with one "", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.You are given a binary string s that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string s.Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of "" that can be replaced by "" such that the requirement will still be satisfied?For example, if n=6, k=1, s= "", then the answer to the problem will be 1, since only the table at position 3 can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.
574	Task On The Board Polycarp wrote on the board a string s containing only lowercase Latin letters (''-''). This string is known for you and given in the input.After that, he erased some letters from the string s, and he rewrote the remaining letters in  order. As a result, he got some new string t. You have to find it with some additional information.Suppose that the string t has length m and the characters are numbered from left to right from 1 to m. You are given a sequence of m integers: b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m, where b_i is the sum of the distances |i-j| from the index i to all such indices j that t_j > t_i (consider that ''<''<...<''). In other words, to calculate b_i, Polycarp finds all such indices j that the index j contains a letter that is later in the alphabet than t_i and sums all the values |i-j|.For example, if t = "", then:Thus, if t = "", then b=[6,1,0,1].Given the string s and the array b, find any possible string t for which the following two requirements are fulfilled simultaneously:
575	Necklace Assembly The store sells n beads. The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet (""–""). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.A necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.For example, if the store sells beads "", "", "", "", "", "", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options):And the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store:We call a necklace k-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by k beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace. In particular, a necklace of length 1 is k-beautiful for any integer k. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any k.You are given the integers n and k, and also the string s containing n lowercase letters of the English alphabet — each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a k-beautiful necklace you can assemble.
576	C+= Leo has developed a new programming language C+=. In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a "" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. For example, performing "" when 2, 3 changes the value of  to 5 (the value of  does not change).In a prototype program Leo has two integer variables  and , initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations "" or "". Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of either  or   than a given value n. What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?
577	Codeforces Subsequences Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least k subsequences . Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.Formally, a  subsequence of a string s is a subset of ten characters of s that read  from left to right. For example,  contains  a single time, while  contains  four times: , , , .Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least k  subsequences.
578	Even Picture Leo Jr. draws pictures in his notebook with checkered sheets (that is, each sheet has a regular square grid printed on it). We can assume that the sheets are infinitely large in any direction.To draw a picture, Leo Jr. colors some of the cells on a sheet gray. He considers the resulting picture  if the following conditions are satisfied:Leo Jr. is now struggling to draw a beautiful picture with a particular choice of n. Help him, and provide any example of a beautiful picture.To output cell coordinates in your answer, assume that the sheet is provided with a Cartesian coordinate system such that one of the cells is chosen to be the origin (0, 0), axes 0x and 0y are orthogonal and parallel to grid lines, and a unit step along any axis in any direction takes you to a neighbouring cell.
579	AND, OR and square sum Gottfried learned about binary number representation. He then came up with this task and presented it to you.You are given a collection of n non-negative integers a_1, \ldots, a_n. You are allowed to perform the following operation: choose two distinct indices 1 \leq i, j \leq n. If before the operation a_i = x, a_j = y, then after the operation a_i = x~\mathsf{AND}~y, a_j = x~\mathsf{OR}~y, where \mathsf{AND} and \mathsf{OR} are bitwise AND and OR respectively (refer to the Notes section for formal description). The operation may be performed any number of times (possibly zero).After all operations are done, compute \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 — the sum of squares of all a_i. What is the largest sum of squares you can achieve?
580	Ski Accidents Arthur owns a ski resort on a mountain. There are n landing spots on the mountain numbered from 1 to n from the top to the foot of the mountain. The spots are connected with one-directional ski tracks. All tracks go towards the foot of the mountain, so there are  formed by the tracks. There are , but many tracks may enter the same spot.A skier can start skiing from one spot and stop in another spot if there is a sequence of tracks that lead from the starting spot and end in the ending spot. Unfortunately, recently there were many accidents, because the structure of the resort allows a skier to go through dangerous paths, by reaching high speed and endangering himself and the other customers. Here, a path is called dangerous, if it consists of at least two tracks.Arthur wants to secure his customers by closing some of the spots in a way that there are no dangerous paths in the resort. When a spot is closed, all tracks entering and leaving that spot become unusable. Formally, after closing some of the spots, .Arthur doesn't want to close too many spots. He will be happy to find any way to close  so that the remaining part is safe. Help him find any suitable way to do so.
581	Lamps on a Circle John and his imaginary friend play a game. There are n lamps arranged in a circle. Lamps are numbered 1 through n in clockwise order, that is, lamps i and i + 1 are adjacent for any i = 1, \ldots, n - 1, and also lamps n and 1 are adjacent. Initially all lamps are turned off.John and his friend take turns, with John moving first. On his turn John can choose to terminate the game, or to make a move. To make a move, John can choose any positive number k and turn any k lamps of his choosing on. In response to this move, John's friend will choose k  lamps and turn all of them off (the lamps in the range that were off before this move stay off). Note that the value of k is the same as John's number on his last move. For example, if n = 5 and John have just turned three lamps on, John's friend may choose to turn off lamps 1, 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, or 3, 4, 5, or 4, 5, 1, or 5, 1, 2.After this, John may choose to terminate or move again, and so on. However, John can not make more than 10^4 moves.John wants to maximize the number of lamps turned on at the end of the game, while his friend wants to minimize this number. Your task is to provide a strategy for John to achieve optimal result. Your program will play interactively for John against the jury's interactor program playing for John's friend.Suppose there are n lamps in the game. Let R(n) be the number of turned on lamps at the end of the game if both players act optimally. Your program has to terminate the game with at least R(n) turned on lamps within 10^4 moves. Refer to Interaction section below for interaction details.For technical reasons 
582	FashionabLee Lee thinks a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is  if and only if he can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same time.Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.Now he is shopping: the market has t regular polygons. For each of them print  if it is beautiful and  otherwise.
583	AccurateLee The string s he found is a binary string of length n (i. e. string consists only of -s and -s).In one move he can choose two consecutive characters s_i and s_{i+1}, and if s_i is  and s_{i + 1} is , he can erase  (he can choose which one to erase but he can't erase both characters simultaneously). The string shrinks after erasing.Lee can make an arbitrary number of moves (possibly zero) and he'd like to make the string s as  as possible. He thinks for two different strings x and y, the  string is cleaner, and if they are the same length, then the  string is cleaner.Now you should answer t test cases: for the i-th test case, print the cleanest possible string that Lee can get by doing some number of moves.Small reminder: if we have two strings x and y of the same length then x is lexicographically smaller than y if there is a position i such that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2,..., x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1} and x_i < y_i.
584	RationalLee Lee has n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n in his backpack and he has k friends. Lee would like to distribute  integers in his backpack between his friends, such that the i-th friend will get exactly w_i integers and each integer will be handed over to exactly one friend.Let's define the  of a friend as the sum of the maximum and the minimum integer he'll get.Lee would like to make his friends as happy as possible, in other words, he'd like to maximize the sum of friends' happiness. Now he asks you to calculate the maximum sum of friends' happiness.
585	TediousLee Let's define a  (RDB) of level n as a rooted tree constructed as described below.A rooted dead bush of level 1 is a single vertex. To construct an RDB of level i we, at first, construct an RDB of level i-1, then for each vertex u: Let's define a  as a rooted tree with four vertices: one root vertex (called also as center) with three children. It looks like a claw:Lee has a Rooted Dead Bush of level n. Initially, all vertices of his RDB are green.In one move, he can choose a claw in his RDB, if all vertices in the claw are  and all vertices of the claw are children of its center, then he colors the claw's vertices in yellow.He'd like to know the maximum number of yellow vertices he can achieve. Since the answer might be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
586	DeadLee There are n different types of food and m Lee's best friends. Lee has w_i plates of the i-th type of food and each friend has two different favorite types of food: the i-th friend's favorite types of food are x_i and y_i (x_i \ne y_i).Lee will start calling his friends one by one. Whoever is called will go to the kitchen and will try to eat . Each of the friends will go to the kitchen exactly once.The only problem is the following: if a friend will eat at least one plate of food (in total) then he will be harmless. But if there is nothing left for him to eat (neither x_i nor y_i), he will eat Lee instead \times\_\times.Lee can choose the order of friends to call, so he'd like to determine if he can survive dinner or not. Also, he'd like to know the order itself.
587	BareLee The game is a one versus one game. It has t rounds, each round has two integers s_i and e_i (which are determined and are known before the game begins, s_i and e_i may differ from round to round). The integer s_i is written on the board at the beginning of the corresponding round. The players will take turns. Each player will erase the number on the board (let's say it was a) and will choose to write either 2 \cdot a or a + 1 instead. Whoever writes a number strictly greater than e_i loses that round and the other one wins that round.Now Lee wants to play "Critic" against Ice Bear, for each round he has chosen the round's s_i and e_i in advance. Lee will start the first round, the loser of each round will start the next round.The winner of the last round is the winner of the game, and the loser of the last round is the loser of the game.Determine if Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves or not. Also, determine if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves or not.
588	Maximum GCD Let's consider all integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).Among all pairs of  integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of \mathrm{gcd}(a, b), where 1 \leq a < b \leq n.The greatest common divisor, \mathrm{gcd}(a, b), of two positive integers a and b is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both a and b.
589	GCD Compression Ashish has an array a of consisting of 2n positive integers. He wants to compress a into an array b of size n-1. To do this, he first discards exactly 2 (any two) elements from a. He then performs the following operation until there are no elements left in a: The compressed array b has to have a special property. The greatest common divisor (\mathrm{gcd}) of all its elements should be greater than 1.Recall that the \mathrm{gcd} of an array of positive integers is the biggest integer that is a divisor of all integers in the array.It can be proven that it is always possible to compress array a into an array b of size n-1 such that gcd(b_1, b_2..., b_{n-1}) > 1. Help Ashish find a way to do so.
590	Number Game Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make  of the following moves:Divisors of a number include the number itself.The player who is  loses the game.Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.
591	Odd-Even Subsequence Ashish has an array a of size n.A subsequence of a is defined as a sequence that can be obtained from a by deleting some elements (possibly none), without changing the order of the remaining elements.Consider a subsequence s of a. He defines the cost of s as the minimum between: Note that the index of an element is its index in s, rather than its index in a. The positions are numbered from 1. So, the cost of s is equal to min(max(s_1, s_3, s_5, \ldots), max(s_2, s_4, s_6, \ldots)).For example, the cost of \{7, 5, 6\} is min( max(7, 6), max(5) ) = min(7, 5) = 5.Help him find the minimum cost of a subsequence of size k.
592	Binary Subsequence Rotation Naman has two binary strings s and t of length n (a binary string is a string which only consists of the characters "" and ""). He wants to convert s into t using the following operation as few times as possible.In one operation, he can choose any subsequence of s and rotate it clockwise once.For example, if s = 1\textbf{1}101\textbf{00}, he can choose a subsequence corresponding to indices (1-based) \{2, 6, 7 \} and rotate them clockwise. The resulting string would then be s = 1\textbf{0}101\textbf{10}.A string a is said to be a subsequence of string b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.To perform a clockwise rotation on a sequence c of size k is to perform an operation which sets c_1:=c_k, c_2:=c_1, c_3:=c_2, \ldots, c_k:=c_{k-1} simultaneously.Determine the minimum number of operations Naman has to perform to convert s into t or say that it is impossible. 
593	Magical Sticks A penguin Rocher has n sticks. He has exactly one stick with length i for all 1 \le i \le n.He can connect some sticks. If he connects two sticks that have lengths a and b, he gets one stick with length a + b. Two sticks, that were used in the operation disappear from his set and the new connected stick appears in his set and can be used for the next connections.He wants to create the maximum number of sticks that have the same length. It is not necessary to make all sticks have the same length, some sticks can have the other length. How many sticks with the equal length he can create?
594	Magical Calendar A competitive eater, Alice is scheduling some practices for an eating contest on a magical calendar. The calendar is unusual because a week contains not necessarily 7 days!In detail, she can choose any integer k which satisfies 1 \leq k \leq r, and set k days as the number of days in a week.Alice is going to paint some n consecutive days on this calendar. On this calendar, dates are written from the left cell to the right cell in a week. If a date reaches the last day of a week, the next day's cell is the leftmost cell in the next (under) row.She wants to make . It means, that for any two painted cells there should exist at least one sequence of painted cells, started in one of these cells, and ended in another, such that any two consecutive cells in this sequence are connected by side.Alice is considering the shape of the painted cells. Two shapes are the same if there exists a way to make them exactly overlapped .For example, in the picture, a week has 4 days and Alice paints 5 consecutive days. [1] and [2] are different shapes, but [1] and [3] are equal shapes.Alice wants to know  exists . As was said before, she considers only shapes, there all cells are connected by side.
595	A Cookie for You Anna is a girl so brave that she is loved by everyone in the city and citizens love her cookies. She is planning to hold a party with cookies. Now she has a vanilla cookies and b chocolate cookies for the party.She invited n guests of the first type and m guests of the second type to the party. They will come to the party in some order. After coming to the party, each guest will choose the type of cookie (vanilla or chocolate) to eat. There is a difference in the way how they choose that type:If there are v vanilla cookies and c chocolate cookies at the moment, when the guest comes, thenAfter that:Anna wants to know if there exists some order of guests, such that . Your task is to answer her question.
596	Grid-00100 A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!You are given integers n,k. Construct a grid A with size n \times n . The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly k. In other words, the number of 1 in the grid is equal to k.Let's define:Find any grid A, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value f(A) is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.
597	Raging Thunder You are a warrior fighting against the machine god Thor.Thor challenge you to solve the following problem:There are n conveyors arranged in a line numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. Each conveyor has a symbol "" or "". The initial state of the conveyor i is equal to the i-th character of the string s. There are n+1 holes numbered with integers from 0 to n. The hole 0 is on the left side of the conveyor 1, and for all i \geq 1 the hole i is on the right side of the conveyor i.When a ball is on the conveyor i, the ball moves by the next rules:If the symbol "" is on the conveyor i, then:If the symbol "" is on the conveyor i, then:You should answer next q queries, each query is defined by the pair of integers l, r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n): 
598	Omkar and Completion You have been blessed as a child of Omkar. To express your gratitude, please solve this problem for Omkar!An array a of length n is called  if all elements are positive and don't exceed 1000, and for all indices x,y,z (1 \leq x,y,z \leq n), a_{x}+a_{y} \neq a_{z} (not necessarily distinct).You are given one integer n. Please find any  array of length n. It is guaranteed that under given constraints such array exists.
599	Omkar and Last Class of Math In Omkar's last class of math, he learned about the least common multiple, or LCM. LCM(a, b) is the smallest positive integer x which is divisible by both a and b.Omkar, having a laudably curious mind, immediately thought of a problem involving the LCM operation: given an integer n, find positive integers a and b such that a + b = n and LCM(a, b) is the minimum value possible.Can you help Omkar solve his ludicrously challenging math problem?
600	Omkar and Baseball Patrick likes to play baseball, but sometimes he will spend so many hours hitting home runs that his mind starts to get foggy! Patrick is sure that his scores across n sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores 1 point, in the second game he scores 2 points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up! Define a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on [1,2,3] can yield [3,1,2] but it cannot yield [3,2,1] since the 2 is in the same position. Given a permutation of n integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed 10^{18}.An array a is a subarray of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
601	Omkar and Circle Danny, the local Math Maniac, is fascinated by circles, Omkar's most recent creation. Help him solve this circle problem!You are given n nonnegative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n arranged in a circle, where n must be odd (ie. n-1 is divisible by 2). Formally, for all i such that 2 \leq i \leq n, the elements a_{i - 1} and a_i are considered to be adjacent, and a_n and a_1 are also considered to be adjacent. In one operation, you pick a number on the circle, replace it with the sum of the two elements adjacent to it, and then delete the two adjacent elements from the circle. This is repeated until only one number remains in the circle, which we call the circular value.Help Danny find the maximum possible circular value after some sequences of operations. 
602	Omkar and Last Floor Omkar is building a house. He wants to decide how to make the floor plan for the last floor.Omkar's floor starts out as n rows of m zeros (1 \le n,m \le 100). Every row is divided into intervals such that every 0 in the row is in exactly 1 interval. For every interval for every row, Omkar can change exactly one of the 0s contained in that interval to a 1. Omkar defines the quality of a floor as the sum of the squares of the sums of the values in each column, i. e. if the sum of the values in the i-th column is q_i, then the quality of the floor is \sum_{i = 1}^m q_i^2.Help Omkar find the maximum quality that the floor can have.
603	Omkar and Modes Ray lost his array and needs to find it by asking Omkar. Omkar is willing to disclose that the array has the following qualities:Ray is allowed to send Omkar a series of queries. A query consists of two integers, l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n. Omkar will respond with two integers, x and f. x is the mode of the subarray from index l to index r inclusive. The mode of an array is defined by the number that appears the most frequently. If there are multiple numbers that appear the most number of times, the smallest such number is considered to be the mode. f is the amount of times that x appears in the queried subarray.The array has k (1 \le k \le \min(25000,n)) distinct elements. However, due to Ray's sins, Omkar will not tell Ray what k is. Ray is allowed to send at most 4k queries.Help Ray find his lost array.
604	Donut Shops There are two rival donut shops.The first shop sells donuts at retail: each donut costs a dollars.The second shop sells donuts only in bulk: box of b donuts costs c dollars. So if you want to buy x donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to x.You want to determine two  values: If any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to -1. If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them.
605	01 Game Alica and Bob are playing a game.Initially they have a binary string s consisting of only characters  and .Alice and Bob make alternating moves: Alice makes the first move, Bob makes the second move, Alice makes the third one, and so on. During each move, the current player must choose two  characters of string s and delete them. For example, if s = 1011001 then the following moves are possible: If a player can't make any move, they lose. Both players play optimally. You have to determine if Alice can win.
606	Pluses and Minuses You are given a string s consisting only of characters  and . You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode: Note that the inf denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from 1 to |s|.You have to calculate the value of the res after the process ends.
607	Maximum Sum on Even Positions You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Indices of the array start from zero (i. e. the first element is a_0, the second one is a_1, and so on).You can reverse  subarray (continuous subsegment) of this array. Recall that the subarray of a with borders l and r is a[l; r] = a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_{r}.Your task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum of elements on  positions of the resulting array is  (i. e. the sum of elements a_0, a_2, \dots, a_{2k} for integer k = \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor should be maximum possible).You have to answer t independent test cases.
608	Sum of Digits Let f(x) be the sum of digits of a decimal number x.Find the smallest non-negative integer x such that f(x) + f(x + 1) + \dots + f(x + k) = n.
609	Network Coverage The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and n cities  around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the i-th city contains a_i households that require a connection.The government designed a plan to build n network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the i-th network station will provide service only for the i-th and the (i + 1)-th city (the n-th station is connected to the n-th and the 1-st city).All network stations have capacities: the i-th station can provide the connection to at most b_i households.Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not — that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station i provides the connection to at most b_i households.
610	Required Remainder You are given three integers x, y and n. Your task is to find the  integer k such that 0 \le k \le n that k \bmod x = y, where \bmod is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator  to implement it.In other words, with given x, y and n you need to find the maximum possible integer from 0 to n that has the remainder y modulo x.You have to answer t independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such k exists for each test case.
611	Multiply by 2, divide by 6 You are given an integer n. In one move, you can either multiply n by two or divide n by 6 (if it is divisible by 6 without the remainder).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from n or determine if it's impossible to do that.You have to answer t independent test cases.
612	Move Brackets You are given a bracket sequence s of length n, where n is even (divisible by two). The string s consists of \frac{n}{2} opening brackets '' and \frac{n}{2} closing brackets ''.In one move, you can choose  and move it to the beginning of the string or to the end of the string (i.e. you choose some index i, remove the i-th character of s and insert it before or after all remaining characters of s).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain  from s. It can be proved that the answer always exists under the given constraints.Recall what the regular bracket sequence is:For example, "", "", "" and "" are regular bracket sequences, but "", "" and "" are not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
613	Zero Remainder Array You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers.Initially, you have an integer x = 0. During one move, you can do one of the following two operations:The first operation can be applied  to each i from 1 to n.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain such an array that each its element is  k (the value k is given).You have to answer t independent test cases. 
614	Cyclic Shifts Sorting You are given an array a consisting of n integers.In one move, you can choose some index i (1 \le i \le n - 2) and shift the segment [a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}] cyclically to the right (i.e. replace the segment [a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}] with [a_{i + 2}, a_i, a_{i + 1}]). Your task is to sort the initial array by  or say that it is impossible to do that.You have to answer t independent test cases.
615	Sign Flipping You are given n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where n . You are allowed to flip the sign of some (possibly all or none) of them. You wish to perform these flips in such a way that the following conditions hold:Find any valid way to flip the signs. It can be shown that under the given constraints, there always exists at least one choice of signs to flip that satisfies the required condition. If there are several solutions, you can find any of them.
616	Neighbor Grid You are given a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell has a non-negative integer written on it. We say the grid is  if for each cell the following condition holds: if it has a number k > 0 written on it, then exactly k of its neighboring cells have a number greater than 0 written on them. Note that if the number in the cell is 0, there is no such restriction on neighboring cells.You are allowed to take any number in the grid and increase it by 1. You may apply this operation as many times as you want, to any numbers you want. Perform some operations (possibly zero) to make the grid good, or say that it is impossible. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.Two cells are considered to be neighboring if they have a common edge.
617	Element Extermination You are given an array a of length n, which initially is a  of numbers from 1 to n. In one operation, you can choose an index i (1 \leq i < n) such that a_i < a_{i + 1}, and remove either a_i or a_{i + 1} from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated). For example, if you have the array [1, 3, 2], you can choose i = 1 (since a_1 = 1 < a_2 = 3), then either remove a_1 which gives the new array [3, 2], or remove a_2 which gives the new array [1, 2].Is it possible to make the length of this array equal to 1 with these operations?
618	Replace by MEX You're given an array of n integers between 0 and n inclusive.In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and replace it by the MEX of the elements of the array (which may change after the operation).For example, if the current array is [0, 2, 2, 1, 4], you can choose the second element and replace it by the MEX of the present elements  — 3. Array will become [0, 3, 2, 1, 4].You must make the array non-decreasing, using at most 2n operations.It can be proven that it is always possible. Please note that you do  have to minimize the number of operations. If there are many solutions, you can print any of them. –An array b[1 \ldots n] is non-decreasing if and only if b_1 \le b_2 \le \ldots \le b_n.The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:It's worth mentioning that the MEX of an array of length n is always between 0 and n inclusive.
619	Inversion SwapSort Madeline has an array a of n integers. A pair (u, v) of integers forms an inversion in a if:Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices u and v and swap the values a_u and a_v. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs (u_i, v_i) with the following conditions:Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.
620	Integer Game Anton and Harris are playing a game to decide which of them is the king of problemsetting.There are three piles of stones, initially containing a, b, and c stones, where a, b, and c are  positive integers. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of events takes place:The second player loses if, at any point, two of the piles contain the same number of stones. The first player loses if 1000 turns have passed without the second player losing.Feeling confident in his skills, Anton decided to let Harris choose whether he wants to go first or second. Help Harris defeat Anton and become the king of problemsetting!
621	Acacius and String Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.You are given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?Each question mark should be replaced with  lowercase English letter. For example, string "" can be transformed into strings "" and "", but can't be transformed into strings "", "" and "".Occurrence of a string t of length m in the string s of length n as a substring is a index i (1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1) such that string s[i..i+m-1] consisting of m consecutive symbols of s starting from i-th equals to string t. For example string "" has two occurrences of a string "" as a substring with i = 1 and i = 3, but there are no occurrences of a string "" in the string "" as a substring.Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "" occurs as a substring in a resulting string .
622	Dubious Cyrpto Pasha loves to send strictly positive integers to his friends. Pasha cares about security, therefore when he wants to send an integer n, he encrypts it in the following way: he picks three integers a, b and c such that l \leq a,b,c \leq r, and then he computes the encrypted value m = n \cdot a + b - c.Unfortunately, an adversary intercepted the values l, r and m. Is it possible to recover the original values of a, b and c from this information? More formally, you are asked to find  values of a, b and c such that
623	Choosing flowers Vladimir would like to prepare a present for his wife: they have an anniversary! He decided to buy her  n flowers.Vladimir went to a flower shop, and he was amazed to see that there are m types of flowers being sold there, and there is unlimited supply of flowers of each type. Vladimir wants to choose flowers to maximize the happiness of his wife. He knows that after receiving the first flower of the i-th type happiness of his wife increases by a_i and after receiving each consecutive flower of this type her happiness increases by b_i. That is, if among the chosen flowers there are x_i > 0 flowers of type i, his wife gets a_i + (x_i - 1) \cdot b_i additional happiness (and if there are no flowers of type i, she gets nothing for this particular type).Please help Vladimir to choose exactly n flowers to maximize the total happiness of his wife.
624	New Passenger Trams There are many freight trains departing from Kirnes planet every day. One day on that planet consists of h hours, and each hour consists of m minutes, where m is an even number. Currently, there are n freight trains, and they depart every day at the same time: i-th train departs at h_i hours and m_i minutes.The government decided to add passenger trams as well: they plan to add a regular tram service with half-hour intervals. It means that the first tram of the day must depart at 0 hours and t minutes, where 0 \le t < {m \over 2}, the second tram departs m \over 2 minutes after the first one and so on. This schedule allows exactly two passenger trams per hour, which is a great improvement.To allow passengers to board the tram safely, the tram must arrive k minutes before. During the time when passengers are boarding the tram, no freight train can depart from the planet. However, freight trains are allowed to depart at the very moment when the boarding starts, as well as at the moment when the passenger tram departs. Note that, if the first passenger tram departs at 0 hours and t minutes, where t < k, then the freight trains can not depart during the last k - t minutes of the day.Unfortunately, it might not be possible to satisfy the requirements of the government without canceling some of the freight trains. Please help the government find the optimal value of t to minimize the number of canceled freight trains in case all passenger trams depart according to schedule.
625	Inverse Genealogy Ivan is fond of genealogy. Currently he is studying a particular genealogical structure, which consists of some people. In this structure every person has either both parents specified, or none. Additionally, each person has exactly one child, except for one special person, who does not have any children. The people in this structure are conveniently numbered from 1 to n, and s_i denotes the child of the person i (and s_i = 0 for exactly one person who does not have any children).We say that a is an ancestor of b if either a = b, or a has a child, who is an ancestor of b. That is a is an ancestor for a, s_a, s_{s_a}, etc.We say that person i is  in case this person has both parents specified, and the total number of ancestors of one of the parents is at least double the other. Ivan counted the number of imbalanced people in the structure, and got k people in total. However, he is not sure whether he computed it correctly, and would like to check if there is at least one construction with n people that have k imbalanced people in total. Please help him to find one such construction, or determine if it does not exist.
626	Three Indices You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. Recall that sequence of n integers is called a  if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.Find three indices i, j and k such that: 
627	Universal Solution Recently, you found a bot to play "Rock paper scissors" with. Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string s = s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n} of length n where each letter is either ,  or .While initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index pos (1 \le pos \le n), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses "Rock", "Scissors" or "Paper" based on the value of s_{pos}: In the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of s_{pos + 1}. In the third round — on s_{pos + 2} and so on. After s_n the bot returns to s_1 and continues his game.You plan to play n rounds and you've already figured out the string s but still don't know what is the starting index pos. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find n choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.In other words, let's suggest your choices are c_1 c_2 \dots c_n and if the bot starts from index pos then you'll win in win(pos) rounds. Find c_1 c_2 \dots c_n such that \frac{win(1) + win(2) + \dots + win(n)}{n} is maximum possible.
628	Create The Teams There are n programmers that you want to split into several non-empty teams. The skill of the i-th programmer is a_i. You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least x.Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team.Calculate the maximum number of teams that you can assemble.
629	Berserk And Fireball There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.You have two types of spells which you may cast: For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n into b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.
630	Merging Towers You have a set of n discs, the i-th disc has radius i. Initially, these discs are split among m towers: each tower contains at least one disc, and the discs in each tower are sorted in descending order of their radii from bottom to top.You would like to assemble one tower containing all of those discs. To do so, you may choose two different towers i and j (each containing at least one disc), take several (possibly all) top discs from the tower i and put them on top of the tower j in the same order, as long as the top disc of tower j is bigger than each of the discs you move. You may perform this operation any number of times.For example, if you have two towers containing discs [6, 4, 2, 1] and [8, 7, 5, 3] (in order from bottom to top), there are only two possible operations:Let the  of some set of towers be the minimum number of operations required to assemble one tower containing all of the discs. For example, the  of the set of towers [[3, 1], [2]] is 2: you may move the disc 1 to the second tower, and then move both discs from the second tower to the first tower.You are given m - 1 queries. Each query is denoted by two numbers a_i and b_i, and means "merge the towers a_i and b_i" (that is, take all discs from these two towers and assemble a new tower containing all of them in descending order of their radii from top to bottom). The resulting tower gets index a_i.For each k \in [0, m - 1], calculate the  of the set of towers after the first k queries are performed.
631	Strange Addition Let a and b be some non-negative integers. Let's define  of a and b as following:Assume that both numbers have an infinite number of leading zeros.For example, let's take a look at a  of numbers 3248 and 908:You are given a string c, consisting of n digits from 0 to 9. You are also given m updates of form: Note that string c might have leading zeros at any point of time.After each update print the number of pairs (a, b) such that both a and b are non-negative integers and the result of a  of a and b is equal to c.Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo 998244353.
632	Unmerge Let a and b be two arrays of lengths n and m, respectively, with no elements in common. We can define a new array \mathrm{merge}(a,b) of length n+m recursively as follows:This algorithm has the nice property that if a and b are sorted, then \mathrm{merge}(a,b) will also be sorted. For example, it is used as a subroutine in merge-sort. For this problem, however, we will consider the same procedure acting on non-sorted arrays as well. For example, if a=[3,1] and b=[2,4], then \mathrm{merge}(a,b)=[2,3,1,4].A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).There is a permutation p of length 2n. Determine if there exist two arrays a and b, each of length n and with no elements in common, so that p=\mathrm{merge}(a,b).
633	Mastermind In the game of Mastermind, there are two players  — Alice and Bob. Alice has a secret code, which Bob tries to guess. Here, a code is defined as a sequence of n colors. There are exactly n+1 colors in the entire universe, numbered from 1 to n+1 inclusive.When Bob guesses a code, Alice tells him some information about how good of a guess it is, in the form of two integers x and y.The first integer x is the number of indices where Bob's guess correctly matches Alice's code. The second integer y is the size of the intersection of the two codes as multisets. That is, if Bob were to change the order of the colors in his guess, y is the maximum number of indices he could get correct.For example, suppose n=5, Alice's code is [3,1,6,1,2], and Bob's guess is [3,1,1,2,5]. At indices 1 and 2 colors are equal, while in the other indices they are not equal. So x=2. And the two codes have the four colors 1,1,2,3 in common, so y=4.You are given Bob's guess and two values x and y. Can you find one possibility of Alice's code so that the values of x and y are correct?
634	The Majestic Brown Tree Snake There is an undirected tree of n vertices, connected by n-1 bidirectional edges. There is also a snake stuck inside of this tree. Its head is at vertex a and its tail is at vertex b. The snake's body occupies all vertices on the unique simple path between a and b.The snake wants to know if it can reverse itself  — that is, to move its head to where its tail started, and its tail to where its head started. Unfortunately, the snake's movements are restricted to the tree's structure.In an operation, the snake can move its head to an adjacent vertex not currently occupied by the snake. When it does this, the tail moves one vertex closer to the head, so that the length of the snake remains unchanged. Similarly, the snake can also move its tail to an adjacent vertex not currently occupied by the snake. When it does this, the head moves one unit closer to the tail.Determine if it is possible to reverse the snake with some sequence of operations.
635	Origami There is a piece of paper in the shape of a simple polygon with n vertices. The polygon may be non-convex, but we all know that proper origami paper has the property that If you fold the paper along the vertical line x=f, what will be the area of the resulting shape? When you fold, the part of the paper to the left of the line is symmetrically reflected on the right side.Your task is to answer q independent queries for values f_1,\ldots,f_q.
636	Common Subsequence You are given two arrays of integers a_1,\ldots,a_n and b_1,\ldots,b_m.Your task is to find a  array c_1,\ldots,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,\ldots,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,\ldots,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the  possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].
637	Sequential Nim There are n piles of stones, where the i-th pile has a_i stones. Two people play a game, where they take alternating turns removing stones.In a move, a player may remove a positive number of stones from the  (the pile with the minimal index, that has at least one stone). The first player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses the game. If both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.
638	String Transformation 1 Koa the Koala has two strings A and B of the same length n (|A|=|B|=n) consisting of the first 20 lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from  to ).In one move Koa:    .Koa wants to know the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other (A = B) or to determine that there is no way to make them equal. Help her!
639	GameGame Koa the Koala and her best friend want to play a game.The game starts with an array a of length n consisting of non-negative integers. Koa and her best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to 0. Koa starts.Let's describe a move in the game: More formally: if the current score of the player is x and the chosen element is y, his new score will be x \oplus y. Here \oplus denotes . Note that after a move element y is removed from a. At the end of the game the winner is the player with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a draw.If both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or draw the game.
640	String Transformation 2 Koa the Koala has two strings A and B of the same length n (|A|=|B|=n) consisting of the first 20 lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from  to ).In one move Koa:    .Koa wants to know the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other (A = B) or to determine that there is no way to make them equal. Help her!
641	Rearrange Koa the Koala has a matrix A of n rows and m columns. Elements of this matrix are distinct integers from 1 to n \cdot m (each number from 1 to n \cdot m appears exactly once in the matrix).For any matrix M of n rows and m columns let's define the following:Koa defines S(A) = (X, Y) as the spectrum of A, where X is the set of the maximum values in rows of A and Y is the set of the maximum values in columns of A.More formally:Koa asks you to find some matrix A' of n rows and m columns, such that each number from 1 to n \cdot m appears exactly once in the matrix, and the following conditions hold: More formally: t is bitonic if there exists some position p (1 \le p \le k) such that: t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_p > t_{p+1} > \ldots > t_k.Help Koa to find such matrix or to determine that it doesn't exist.
642	Strange Operation Koa the Koala has a binary string s of length n. Koa can perform no more than n-1 (possibly zero) operations of the following form:In one operation Koa selects positions i and i+1 for some i with 1 \le i < |s| and sets s_i to max(s_i, s_{i+1}). Then Koa deletes position i+1 from s (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).Note that after every operation the length of s decreases by 1.How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than n-1 (possibly zero) operations modulo 10^9+7 (1000000007)?
643	Special Edges Koa the Koala has a  graph G with n nodes and m edges. Each edge has a capacity associated with it. Exactly k edges of the graph, numbered from 1 to k, are special, such edges initially have a capacity equal to 0.Koa asks you q queries. In each query she gives you k integers w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k. This means that capacity of the i-th special edge becomes w_i (and other capacities remain the same).Koa wonders: what is the  that goes from node 1 to node n after each such query?Help her!
644	Common Prefixes The length of the  of two strings s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n and t = t_1 t_2 \ldots t_m is defined as the maximum integer k (0 \le k \le min(n,m)) such that s_1 s_2 \ldots s_k equals t_1 t_2 \ldots t_k.Koa the Koala initially has n+1 strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{n+1}.For each i (1 \le i \le n) she calculated a_i — the length of the  of s_i and s_{i+1}.Several days later Koa found these numbers, but she couldn't remember the strings.So Koa would like to find some strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{n+1} which would have generated numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Can you help her?If there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints. 
645	Three Pairwise Maximums You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers x, y and z.Your task is to find positive integers a, b and c such that x = \max(a, b), y = \max(a, c) and z = \max(b, c), or determine that it is impossible to find such a, b and c.You have to answer t independent test cases. Print required a, b and c in any (arbitrary) order.
646	Restore the Permutation by Merger A permutation of length n is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once. For example, [1], [4, 3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1] are permutations, and [1, 1], [0, 1], [2, 2, 1, 4] are not.There was a permutation p[1 \dots n]. It was merged with itself. In other words, let's take two instances of p and insert elements of the second p into the first maintaining relative order of elements. The result is a sequence of the length 2n.For example, if p=[3, 1, 2] some possible results are: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2], [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3], [3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1], [3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1].For example, if p=[2, 1] the possible results are: [2, 2, 1, 1], [2, 1, 2, 1]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1, 1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2, 1].Your task is to restore the permutation p by the given resulting sequence a. It is guaranteed that the answer .You have to answer t independent test cases.
647	Make It Good You are given an array a consisting of n integers. You have to find the length of the smallest (shortest)  of elements you need to erase from a to make it a  array. Recall that the prefix of the array a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] is a subarray consisting several first elements: the prefix of the array a of length k is the array [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k] (0 \le k \le n).The array b of length m is called , if you can obtain a  array c (c_1 \le c_2 \le \dots \le c_{m}) from it, repeating the following operation m times (initially, c is empty):For example, if we do 4 operations: take b_1, then b_{m}, then b_{m-1} and at last b_2, then b becomes [b_3, b_4, \dots, b_{m-3}] and c =[b_1, b_{m}, b_{m-1}, b_2].Consider the following example: b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]. This array is  because we can obtain  array c from it by the following sequence of operations:Note that the array consisting of one element is .Print the length of the shortest prefix of a to delete (erase), to make a to be a  array. Note that the required length can be 0.You have to answer t independent test cases.
648	a-Good String You are given a string s[1 \dots n] consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that n = 2^k for some integer k \ge 0.The string s[1 \dots n] is called  if  of the following three conditions is satisfied:For example: "" is , "" is .In one move, you can choose one index i from 1 to n and replace s_i with any lowercase Latin letter (any character from '' to '').Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an  string from s (i.e.  for c= ''). It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.You have to answer t independent test cases.Another example of an  string is as follows. Consider the string s = "". It is an  string, because:
649	Directing Edges You are given a graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges.You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct  undirected edges.You have to answer t independent test cases.
650	Removing Leaves You are given a tree (connected graph without cycles) consisting of n vertices. The tree is unrooted — it is just a connected undirected graph without cycles.In one move, you can choose exactly k leaves (leaf is such a vertex that is connected to only one another vertex) connected  and remove them with edges incident to them. I.e. you choose such leaves u_1, u_2, \dots, u_k that there are edges (u_1, v), (u_2, v), \dots, (u_k, v) and remove these leaves and these edges.Your task is to find the  number of moves you can perform if you remove leaves optimally.You have to answer t independent test cases.
651	Colors Linda likes to change her hair color from time to time, and would be pleased if her boyfriend Archie would notice the difference between the previous and the new color. Archie always comments on Linda's hair color if and only if he notices a difference — so Linda always knows whether Archie has spotted the difference or not.There is a new hair dye series in the market where all available colors are numbered by integers from 1 to N such that a smaller difference of the numerical values also means less visual difference.Linda assumes that for these series there should be some  C (1 \le C \le N) for which Archie will notice color difference between the current color \mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{new}} and the previous color \mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{prev}} if \left|\mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{new}} - \mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{prev}}\right| \ge C and will not if \left|\mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{new}} - \mathrm{color}_{\mathrm{prev}}\right| < C.Now she has bought N sets of hair dye from the new series — one for each of the colors from 1 to N, and is ready to set up an experiment. Linda will change her hair color on a regular basis and will observe Archie's reaction — whether he will notice the color change or not. Since for the proper dye each set should be used completely, each hair color can be obtained no more than once.Before the experiment, Linda was using a dye from a different series which is not compatible with the new one, so for the clearness of the experiment Archie's reaction to the first used color is meaningless.Her aim is to find the precise value of C in a limited number of dyes. Write a program which finds the value of C by experimenting with the given N colors and observing Archie's reactions to color changes.
652	Mixture Serge, the chef of the famous restaurant "Salt, Pepper & Garlic" is trying to obtain his first Michelin star. He has been informed that a secret expert plans to visit his restaurant this evening.Even though the expert's name hasn't been disclosed, Serge is certain he knows which dish from the menu will be ordered as well as what the taste preferences of the expert are. Namely, the expert requires an extremely precise proportion of salt, pepper and garlic powder in his dish.Serge keeps a set of bottles with mixtures of salt, pepper and garlic powder on a special shelf in the kitchen. For each bottle, he knows the exact amount of each of the ingredients in kilograms. Serge can combine any number of bottled mixtures (or just use one of them directly) to get a mixture of particular proportions needed for a certain dish.Luckily, the absolute amount of a mixture that needs to be added to a dish is so small that you can assume that the amounts in the bottles will always be sufficient. However, the numeric values describing the proportions may be quite large.Serge would like to know whether it is possible to obtain the expert's favourite mixture from the available bottles, and if so—what is the smallest possible number of bottles needed to achieve that.Furthermore, the set of bottles on the shelf may change over time as Serge receives new ones or lends his to other chefs. So he would like to answer this question after each such change.For example, assume that expert's favorite mixture is 1:1:1 and there are three bottles of mixtures on the shelf:To obtain the desired mixture it is enough to use an equivalent amount of mixtures from bottles 1 and 2. If bottle 2 is removed, then it is no longer possible to obtain it.Write a program that helps Serge to solve this task!
653	Joker Joker returns to Gotham City to execute another evil plan. In Gotham City, there are N street junctions (numbered from 1 to N) and M streets (numbered from 1 to M). Each street connects two distinct junctions, and two junctions are connected by at most one street.For his evil plan, Joker needs to use an odd number of streets that together form a cycle. That is, for a junction S and an  positive integer k, there is a sequence of junctions S, s_1, \ldots, s_k, S such that there are streets connecting (a) S and s_1, (b) s_k and S, and (c) s_{i-1} and s_i for each i = 2, \ldots, k.However, the police are controlling the streets of Gotham City. On each day i, they monitor a different subset of all streets with consecutive numbers j: l_i \leq j \leq r_i. These monitored streets cannot be a part of Joker's plan, of course. Unfortunately for the police, Joker has spies within the Gotham City Police Department; they tell him which streets are monitored on which day. Now Joker wants to find out, for some given number of days, whether he can execute his evil plan. On such a day there must be a cycle of streets, consisting of an odd number of streets which are not monitored on that day.
654	Graph You are given an undirected graph where each edge has one of two colors: black or red.Your task is to assign a real number to each node so that: Otherwise, if it is not possible, report that there is no feasible assignment of the numbers.
655	Viruses The Committee for Research on Binary Viruses discovered a method of replication for a large family of viruses whose genetic codes are sequences of zeros and ones. Each virus originates from a single gene; for simplicity genes are denoted by integers from 0 to G - 1. At each moment in time a virus is a sequence of genes. When mutation occurs, one of the genes from the sequence is replaced by a certain sequence of genes, according to the mutation table. The virus stops mutating when it consists only of genes 0 and 1.For instance, for the following mutation table:  2 \to \langle 0\ 1 \rangle \\ 3 \to \langle 2\ 0\ 0\rangle\\ 3 \to \langle 1\ 3\rangle\\ 4 \to \langle 0\ 3\ 1\ 2\rangle\\ 5 \to \langle 2\ 1\rangle\\ 5 \to \langle 5\rangle  a virus that initially consisted of a single gene 4, could have mutated as follows:  \langle 4 \rangle \to \langle \underline{0\ 3\ 1\ 2} \rangle \to \langle 0\ \underline{2\ 0\ 0}\ 1\ 2 \rangle \to \langle 0\ \underline{0\ 1}\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 2 \rangle \to \langle 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\ \underline{0\ 1} \rangle  or in another way:  \langle 4 \rangle \to \langle \underline{0\ 3\ 1\ 2} \rangle \to \langle 0\ \underline{1\ 3}\ 1\ 2 \rangle \to \langle 0\ 1\ 3\ 1\ \underline{0\ 1} \rangle \to \langle 0\ 1\ \underline{2\ 0\ 0}\ 1\ 0\ 1 \rangle \to \langle 0\ 1\ \underline{0\ 1}\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1 \rangle Viruses are detected by antibodies that identify the presence of specific continuous fragments of zeros and ones in the viruses' codes. For example, an antibody reacting to a fragment \langle 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0 \rangle will detect a virus \langle 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1 \rangle, but it will not detect a virus \langle 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1 \rangle.For each gene from 2 to G-1, the scientists are wondering whether a given set of antibodies is enough to detect all viruses that can emerge through mutations from this gene. If not, they want to know the length of the shortest virus that cannot be detected.It may happen that sometimes scientists don't have any antibodies. Then of course no virus can be detected, so the scientists are only interested in the length of the shortest possible virus that can emerge from the gene mutations.
656	Captain Flint and Crew Recruitment Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer x as  if it can be represented as p \cdot q, where 1 < p < q and p and q are prime numbers. For example, integers 6 and 10 are nearly primes (since 2 \cdot 3 = 6 and 2 \cdot 5 = 10), but integers 1, 3, 4, 16, 17 or 44 are not.Captain Flint guessed an integer n and asked you: can you represent it as  where  of them should be .Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?
657	Captain Flint and a Long Voyage In the beginning, uncle Bogdan wrote on a board a positive integer x consisting of n digits. After that, he wiped out x and wrote integer k instead, which was the concatenation of binary representations of digits x consists of (without leading zeroes). For example, let x = 729, then k = 111101001 (since 7 = 111, 2 = 10, 9 = 1001).After some time, uncle Bogdan understood that he doesn't know what to do with k and asked Denis to help. Denis decided to wipe last n digits of k and named the new number as r.As a result, Denis proposed to find such integer x of length n that r (as number) is maximum possible. If there are multiple valid x then Denis is interested in the minimum one.All crew members, including captain Flint himself, easily solved the task. All, except cabin boy Kostya, who was too drunk to think straight. But what about you?Note: in this task, we compare integers (x or k) as numbers (despite what representations they are written in), so 729 < 1999 or 111 < 1000.
658	Uncle Bogdan and Country Happiness There are n cities and n−1 undirected roads connecting pairs of cities. Citizens of any city can reach any other city traveling by these roads. Cities are numbered from 1 to n and the city 1 is a capital. In other words, the country has a tree structure.There are m citizens living in the country. A p_i people live in the i-th city but all of them are working in the capital. At evening all citizens return to their home cities using the shortest paths. Every person has its own mood: somebody leaves his workplace in good mood but somebody are already in bad mood. Moreover any person can ruin his mood on the way to the hometown. .Happiness detectors are installed in each city to monitor the happiness of  person who visits the city. The detector in the i-th city calculates a happiness index h_i as the number of people in good mood minus the number of people in bad mood. Let's say for the simplicity that .Happiness detector is still in development, so there is a probability of a mistake in judging a person's happiness. One late evening, when all citizens successfully returned home, the government asked uncle Bogdan (the best programmer of the country) to check the correctness of the collected happiness indexes.Uncle Bogdan successfully solved the problem. Can you do the same?More formally, 
659	Captain Flint and Treasure There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 \le i \le n) ?Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.
660	Uncle Bogdan and Projections There are n non-intersecting horizontal segments with ends in integers points on the plane with the standard cartesian coordinate system. All segments are strictly above the OX axis. You can choose an arbitrary vector (a, b), where b < 0 and coordinates are real numbers, and project all segments to OX axis along this vector. Find the minimum possible difference between x coordinate of the right end of the rightmost projection and x coordinate of the left end of the leftmost projection.
661	LCM Problem Let LCM(x, y) be the minimum positive integer that is divisible by both x and y. For example, LCM(13, 37) = 481, LCM(9, 6) = 18.You are given two integers l and r. Find two integers x and y such that l \le x < y \le r and l \le LCM(x, y) \le r.
662	Array Walk You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, consisting of n  integers. Initially you are standing at index 1 and have a score equal to a_1. You can perform two kinds of moves: You want to perform  k moves. Also, there should be no more than z moves to the left among them.What is the maximum score you can achieve?
663	Good String Let's call  of some string t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n as string t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n t_1.Analogically, let's call  of string t as string t_n t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1}.Let's say string t is  if its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.You are given string s which consists of digits –.What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from s to make it good?
664	Segment Intersections You are given two lists of segments [al_1, ar_1], [al_2, ar_2], \dots, [al_n, ar_n] and [bl_1, br_1], [bl_2, br_2], \dots, [bl_n, br_n].Initially, all segments [al_i, ar_i] are equal to [l_1, r_1] and all segments [bl_i, br_i] are equal to [l_2, r_2].In one step, you can choose one segment (either from the first or from the second list) and extend it by 1. In other words, suppose you've chosen segment [x, y] then you can transform it either into [x - 1, y] or into [x, y + 1].Let's define a total intersection I as the sum of lengths of intersections of the corresponding pairs of segments, i.e. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\text{intersection_length}([al_i, ar_i], [bl_i, br_i])}. Empty intersection has length 0 and length of a segment [x, y] is equal to y - x.What is the minimum number of steps you need to make I greater or equal to k?
665	Calendar Ambiguity Berland year consists of m months with d days each. Months are numbered from 1 to m. Berland week consists of w days. The first day of the year is also the first day of the week. Note that the last week of the year might be shorter than w days.A pair (x, y) such that x < y is ambiguous if day x of month y is the same day of the week as day y of month x.Count the number of ambiguous pairs.
666	Bicolored Segments You are given n segments [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \dots, [l_n, r_n]. Each segment has one of two colors: the i-th segment's color is t_i.Let's call a pair of segments i and j  if the following two conditions are met:Calculate the maximum number of segments that can be selected from the given ones, so that there is no  pair among the selected ones.
667	Suborrays A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).For a positive integer n, we call a permutation p of length n  if the following condition holds for every pair i and j (1 \le i \le j \le n) — In other words, a permutation p is  if for every subarray of p, the \text{OR} of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. Given a positive integer n, output any  permutation of length n. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.
668	Fix You Consider a conveyor belt represented using a grid consisting of n rows and m columns. The cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is labelled (i,j). Every cell, except (n,m), has a direction  (Right) or  (Down) assigned to it. If the cell (i,j) is assigned direction , any luggage kept on that will move to the cell (i,j+1). Similarly, if the cell (i,j) is assigned direction , any luggage kept on that will move to the cell (i+1,j). If at any moment, the luggage moves out of the grid, it is considered to be lost. There is a counter at the cell (n,m) from where all luggage is picked. A conveyor belt is called  if and only if any luggage reaches the counter regardless of which cell it is placed in initially. More formally, for every cell (i,j), any luggage placed in this cell should eventually end up in the cell (n,m). This may not hold initially; you are, however, allowed to  the directions of some cells to make the conveyor belt functional. Please determine the minimum amount of cells you have to change.Please note that it is always possible to make any conveyor belt functional by changing the directions of some set of cells.
669	Cyclic Permutations  A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).Consider a permutation p of length n, we build a graph of size n using it as follows: In cases where no such j exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.For clarity, consider as an example n = 4, and p = [3,1,4,2]; here, the edges of the graph are (1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3).A permutation p is  if the graph built using p has at least one simple cycle. Given n, find the number of cyclic permutations of length n. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle
670	505 A binary matrix is called  if every  length square sub-matrix has an  number of ones. Given a binary matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change to make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all. All the terms above have their usual meanings — refer to the Notes section for their formal definitions. 
671	Pairs of Pairs You have a simple and connected undirected graph consisting of n nodes and m edges.Consider any way to pair some subset of these n nodes such that no node is present in more than one pair. This pairing is  if for every pair of pairs, the induced subgraph containing all 4 nodes, two from each pair, has at most 2 edges (out of the 6 possible edges). More formally, for any two pairs, (a,b) and (c,d), the induced subgraph with nodes \{a,b,c,d\} should have at most 2 edges. Please note that the subgraph induced by a set of nodes contains nodes only from this set and edges which have both of its end points in this set.Now, do one of the following: It can be shown that it is possible to find at least one of the two in every graph satisfying constraints from the statement. 
672	Omkar and Password Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 \leq i < n and a_{i} \neq a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?
673	Omkar and Infinity Clock Being stuck at home, Ray became extremely bored. To pass time, he asks Lord Omkar to use his time bending power: Infinity Clock! However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:You are given an array a of n integers. You are also given an integer k. Lord Omkar wants you to do k operations with this array.Define one operation as the following: The goal is to predict the contents in the array after k operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!
674	Omkar and Waterslide Omkar is building a waterslide in his water park, and he needs your help to ensure that he does it as efficiently as possible.Omkar currently has n supports arranged in a line, the i-th of which has height a_i. Omkar wants to build his waterslide from the right to the left, so his supports must be nondecreasing in height in order to support the waterslide. In 1 operation, Omkar can do the following: take any  of supports which is  and add 1 to each of their heights. Help Omkar find the minimum number of operations he needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide!An array b is a subsegment of an array c if b can be obtained from c by deletion of several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.An array b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n is called nondecreasing if b_i\le b_{i+1} for every i from 1 to n-1.
675	Omkar and Bed Wars Omkar is playing his favorite pixelated video game, Bed Wars! In Bed Wars, there are n players arranged in a circle, so that for all j such that 2 \leq j \leq n, player j - 1 is to the left of the player j, and player j is to the right of player j - 1. Additionally, player n is to the left of player 1, and player 1 is to the right of player n.Currently, each player is attacking either the player to their left or the player to their right. This means that each player is currently being attacked by either 0, 1, or 2 other players. A key element of Bed Wars strategy is that if a player is being attacked by exactly 1 other player, then they should logically attack that player in response. If instead a player is being attacked by 0 or 2 other players, then Bed Wars strategy says that the player can logically attack either of the adjacent players.Unfortunately, it might be that some players in this game are not following Bed Wars strategy correctly. Omkar is aware of whom each player is currently attacking, and he can talk to any amount of the n players in the game to make them instead attack another player  — i. e. if they are currently attacking the player to their left, Omkar can convince them to instead attack the player to their right; if they are currently attacking the player to their right, Omkar can convince them to instead attack the player to their left. Omkar would like all players to be acting logically. Calculate the minimum amount of players that Omkar needs to talk to so that after all players he talked to (if any) have changed which player they are attacking, all players are acting logically according to Bed Wars strategy.
676	Omkar and Duck Omkar has just come across a duck! The duck is walking on a grid with n rows and n columns (2 \leq n \leq 25) so that the grid contains a total of n^2 cells. Let's denote by (x, y) the cell in the x-th row from the top and the y-th column from the left. Right now, the duck is at the cell (1, 1) (the cell in the top left corner) and would like to reach the cell (n, n) (the cell in the bottom right corner) by moving either down 1 cell or to the right 1 cell each second.Since Omkar thinks ducks are fun, he wants to play a game with you based on the movement of the duck. First, for each cell (x, y) in the grid, you will tell Omkar a nonnegative integer a_{x,y} not exceeding 10^{16}, and Omkar will then put a_{x,y} uninteresting problems in the cell (x, y). After that, the duck will start their journey from (1, 1) to (n, n). For each cell (x, y) that the duck crosses during their journey (including the cells (1, 1) and (n, n)), the duck will eat the a_{x,y} uninteresting problems in that cell. Once the duck has completed their journey, Omkar will measure their mass to determine the total number k of uninteresting problems that the duck ate on their journey, and then tell you k.Your challenge, given k, is to exactly reproduce the duck's path, i. e. to tell Omkar precisely which cells the duck crossed on their journey. To be sure of your mastery of this game, Omkar will have the duck complete q different journeys (1 \leq q \leq 10^3). Note that all journeys are independent: at the beginning of each journey, the cell (x, y) will still contain a_{x,y} uninteresting tasks.
677	Omkar and Landslide Omkar is standing at the foot of Celeste mountain. The summit is n meters away from him, and he can see all of the mountains up to the summit, so for all 1 \leq j \leq n he knows that the height of the mountain at the point j meters away from himself is h_j meters. It turns out that for all j satisfying 1 \leq j \leq n - 1, h_j < h_{j + 1} (meaning that heights are strictly increasing).Suddenly, a landslide occurs! While the landslide is occurring, the following occurs: every minute, if h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1}, then one square meter of dirt will slide from position j + 1 to position j, so that h_{j + 1} is decreased by 1 and h_j is increased by 1. These changes occur simultaneously, so for example, if h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1} and h_{j + 1} + 2 \leq h_{j + 2} for some j, then h_j will be increased by 1, h_{j + 2} will be decreased by 1, and h_{j + 1} will be both increased and decreased by 1, meaning that in effect h_{j + 1} is unchanged during that minute.The landslide ends when there is no j such that h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1}. Help Omkar figure out what the values of h_1, \dots, h_n will be after the landslide ends. It can be proven that under the given constraints, the landslide will always end in finitely many minutes.Note that because of the large amount of input, it is recommended that your code uses fast IO.
678	Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Chess Coloring One evening Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy have come up with a game. Since the ponies are friends, they have decided not to compete in the game but to pursue a common goal. The game starts on a square flat grid, which initially has the outline borders built up. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy have flat square blocks with size 1\times1, Rainbow Dash has an infinite amount of light blue blocks, Fluttershy has an infinite amount of yellow blocks. The blocks are placed according to the following rule: each newly placed block must touch the built on the previous turns figure by a side (note that the outline borders of the grid are built initially). At each turn, one pony can place any number of blocks of her color according to the game rules.Rainbow and Fluttershy have found out that they can build patterns on the grid of the game that way. They have decided to start with something simple, so they made up their mind to place the blocks to form a . Rainbow Dash is well-known for her speed, so she is interested in the minimum number of turns she and Fluttershy need to do to get a chess coloring, covering the whole grid with blocks. Please help her find that number!Since the ponies can play many times on different boards, Rainbow Dash asks you to find the minimum numbers of turns for several grids of the games.The chess coloring in two colors is the one in which each square is neighbor by side only with squares of different colors.
679	Applejack and Storages This year in Equestria was a year of plenty, so Applejack has decided to build some new apple storages. According to the advice of the farm designers, she chose to build two storages with non-zero area: one in the shape of a square and another one in the shape of a rectangle (which possibly can be a square as well).Applejack will build the storages using planks, she is going to spend exactly one plank on each side of the storage. She can get planks from her friend's company. Initially, the company storehouse has n planks, Applejack knows their lengths. The company keeps working so it receives orders and orders the planks itself. Applejack's friend can provide her with information about each operation. For convenience, he will give her information according to the following format:Applejack is still unsure about when she is going to order the planks so she wants to know if she can order the planks to build rectangular and square storages out of them after every event at the storehouse. Applejack is busy collecting apples and she has completely no time to do the calculations so she asked you for help!We remind you that all four sides of a square are equal, and a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides.
680	Pinkie Pie Eats Patty-cakes Pinkie Pie has bought a bag of patty-cakes with different fillings! But it appeared that not all patty-cakes differ from one another with filling. In other words, the bag contains some patty-cakes with the same filling.Pinkie Pie eats the patty-cakes one-by-one. She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!
681	Rarity and New Dress Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and she surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several times is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which she is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.The piece of the multicolored fabric consists of n \times m separate square scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only include scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and since Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be resembling the traditional picture of a rhombus).Examples of proper dress patterns:  Examples of improper dress patterns:  The first one consists of multi-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of fabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a 45^{\circ} angle with sides of the piece of fabric.Rarity wonders how many ways to cut out a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please help her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new masterpiece!
682	Boboniu Chats with Du Have you ever used the chat application QQ? Well, in a chat group of QQ, administrators can muzzle a user for days.In Boboniu's chat group, there's a person called Du Yi who likes to make fun of Boboniu every day.Du will chat in the group for n days. On the i-th day:Boboniu's mood is a constant m. On the i-th day:The total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak.Du asked you to find the maximum total fun factor among all possible permutations of a.
683	Boboniu Walks on Graph Boboniu has a  graph with n vertices and m edges.The out-degree of each vertex is at most k.Each edge has an integer weight between 1 and m. No two edges have equal weights.Boboniu likes to walk on the graph with some specific rules, which is represented by a tuple (c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k). If he now stands on a vertex u with out-degree i, then he will go to the next vertex by the edge with the c_i-th (1\le c_i\le i) smallest weight among all edges outgoing from u.Now Boboniu asks you to calculate the number of tuples (c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k) such that
684	Boboniu and String Boboniu defines  as a string s of characters 'B' and 'N'.You can perform the following operations on the BN-string s:Note that a string a is a  of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.Boboniu thinks that BN-strings s and t are  if and only if:Boboniu also defines \text{dist}(s,t), the  between s and t, as the minimum number of operations that makes s  to t.Now Boboniu gives you n non-empty BN-strings s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_n and asks you to find a  BN-string t such that the maximum distance to string s is minimized, i.e. you need to minimize \max_{i=1}^n \text{dist}(s_i,t).
685	Boboniu and Jianghu Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day. Boboniu designs a map for his n mountains. He uses n-1 roads to connect all n mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.For the i-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as t_i. He also estimated the height of each mountain as h_i.A  is a sequence of mountains M such that for each i (1 \le i < |M|), there exists a road between M_i and M_{i+1}. Boboniu would regard the  as a  if for each i (1\le i<|M|), h_{M_i}\le h_{M_{i+1}}.Boboniu wants to divide  n-1 roads into several . Note that each road must appear in  challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges. Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the . The tiredness of a  M is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. \sum_{i=1}^{|M|}t_{M_i}. He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.
686	Boboniu and Banknote Collection Boboniu has issued his currencies, named Bobo Yuan. Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:We can use sequence a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1] of length n=9 to denote it.Now Boboniu wants to  his collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if a_i is folded over a_j (1\le i,j\le n), then a_i=a_j must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.A formal definition of  is described in notes.According to the picture above, you can  a two times. In fact, you can  a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1] at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is 2.As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds. You're given a sequence a of length n, for each i (1\le i\le n), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of [a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_i].
687	Boboniu Likes to Color Balls Boboniu gives youHe allows you to do the following operation as many times as you want: You should answer if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a  after several (possibly zero) number of described operations. 
688	Boboniu Plays Chess Boboniu likes playing chess with his employees. As we know, no employee can beat the boss in the chess game, so Boboniu has never lost in any round.You are a new applicant for his company. Boboniu will test you with the following chess question:Consider a n\times m grid (rows are numbered from 1 to n, and columns are numbered from 1 to m). You have a chess piece, and it stands at some cell (S_x,S_y) which is not on the border (i.e. 2 \le S_x \le n-1 and 2 \le S_y \le m-1).From the cell (x,y), you can move your chess piece to (x,y') (1\le y'\le m, y' \neq y) or (x',y) (1\le x'\le n, x'\neq x). In other words, the chess piece moves as a rook. From the cell, you can move to any cell on the same row or column.Your goal is to visit each cell exactly once. Can you find a solution?Note that cells on the path between two adjacent cells in your route are not counted as visited, and it is not required to return to the starting point.
689	Boboniu and Bit Operations Boboniu likes bit operations. He wants to play a game with you.Boboniu gives you two sequences of non-negative integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n and b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m.For each i (1\le i\le n), you're asked to choose a j (1\le j\le m) and let c_i=a_i\& b_j, where \& denotes the . Note that you can pick the same j for different i's.Find the minimum possible c_1 | c_2 | \ldots | c_n, where | denotes the .
690	Multiples of Length You are given an array a of n integers.You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation  times:It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.
691	Stoned Game T is playing a game with his friend, HL.There are n piles of stones, the i-th pile initially has a_i stones. T and HL will take alternating turns, with T going first. In each turn, a player chooses a non-empty pile and then removes a single stone from it. However, one cannot choose a pile that has been chosen in the previous turn (the pile that was chosen by the other player, or if the current turn is the first turn then the player can choose any non-empty pile). The player who cannot choose a pile in his turn loses, and the game ends.Assuming both players play optimally, given the starting configuration of t games, determine the winner of each game.
692	Monster Invaders Ziota found a video game called "Monster Invaders".Similar to every other shooting RPG game, "Monster Invaders" involves killing monsters and bosses with guns.For the sake of simplicity, we only consider two different types of monsters and three different types of guns.Namely, the two types of monsters are: And the three types of guns are: The levels of the game can be considered as an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, in which . Due to the nature of the game, .If Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately,  (adjacent levels of level i (1 < i < n) are levels i - 1 and i + 1, the only adjacent level of level 1 is level 2, the only adjacent level of level n is level n - 1). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. In order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, Ziota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns). Please help him find this value.
693	Rainbow Rectangles Shrimpy Duc is a fat and greedy boy who is always hungry. After a while of searching for food to satisfy his never-ending hunger, Shrimpy Duc finds M&M candies lying unguarded on a L \times L grid. There are n M&M candies on the grid, the i-th M&M is currently located at (x_i + 0.5, y_i + 0.5), and has color c_i out of a total of k colors (the size of M&Ms are insignificant).Shrimpy Duc wants to steal a  of M&Ms, specifically, he wants to select a rectangle with  coordinates within the grid and steal all candies within the rectangle. Shrimpy Duc doesn't need to steal every single candy, however, he would like to steal .In other words, he wants to select a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and whose left-bottom vertex (X_1, Y_1) and right-top vertex (X_2, Y_2) are points with integer coordinates satisfying 0 \le X_1 < X_2 \le L and 0 \le Y_1 < Y_2 \le L, so that for every color 1 \le c \le k there is at least one M&M with color c that lies within that rectangle.How many such rectangles are there? This number may be large, so you only need to find it modulo 10^9 + 7.
694	Distance Matching You are given an integer k and a  T with n nodes (n is even).Let dist(u, v) be the number of edges on the shortest path from node u to node v in T.Let us define a  G = (V, E) as following: Your task is simple, find a  in G with total edge weight k (1 \le k \le n^2).
695	Juggling Letters You are given n strings s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one operation you can remove a character from a string s_i and insert it to an arbitrary position in a string s_j (j may be equal to i). You may perform this operation any number of times. Is it possible to make all n strings equal?
696	Power Sequence Let's call a list of positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} a  if there is a positive integer c, so that for every 0 \le i \le n-1 then a_i = c^i.Given a list of n positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, you are allowed to:Find the minimum cost to transform a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} into a power sequence.
697	Bad Triangle You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n, which is sorted in non-decreasing order (a_i \le a_{i + 1}). Find three indices i, j, k such that 1 \le i < j < k \le n and it is  to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to a_i, a_j and a_k (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides 3, 4 and 5 but impossible with sides 3, 4 and 7). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.
698	Substring Removal Game Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string s (a string such that each character in it is either 0 or 1). Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.During their move, the player can choose any number (not less than one) of  in s and delete them.For example, if the string is 10110, there are 6 possible moves (deleted characters are bold):After the characters are removed, the characters to the left and to the right of the removed block become adjacent. I. e. the following sequence of moves is valid: 10\textbf{11}0 \to 1\textbf{00} \to 1.The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of each player is .Each player wants to maximize their score. Calculate the resulting score of Alice.
699	Good Subarrays You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n consisting of integers from 0 to 9. A subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \dots , a_{r-1}, a_r is good if the sum of elements of this subarray is equal to the length of this subarray (\sum\limits_{i=l}^{r} a_i = r - l + 1).For example, if a = [1, 2, 0], then there are 3 good subarrays: a_{1 \dots 1} = [1], a_{2 \dots 3} = [2, 0] and a_{1 \dots 3} = [1, 2, 0].Calculate the number of good subarrays of the array a.
700	Colored Rectangles You are given three multisets of pairs of colored sticks: You are constructing rectangles from these pairs of sticks with the following process: Thus, you get such rectangles that their opposite sides are the same color and their adjacent sides are not the same color.Each pair of sticks can be used at most once, some pairs can be left unused. You are not allowed to split a pair into independent sticks.What is the maximum area you can achieve?
701	Two Types of Spells Polycarp plays a computer game (yet again). In this game, he fights monsters using magic spells.There are two types of spells:  spell of power x deals x damage to the monster, and  spell of power y deals y damage to the monster and  the damage of the next spell Polycarp casts. Each spell can be cast , but Polycarp can cast them in any order.For example, suppose that Polycarp knows three spells: a fire spell of power 5, a lightning spell of power 1, and a lightning spell of power 8. There are 6 ways to choose the order in which he casts the spells:Initially, Polycarp knows 0 spells. His spell set changes n times, each time he either learns a new spell or forgets an already known one. After each change, calculate the maximum possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he knows.
702	Controversial Rounds Alice and Bob play a game. The game consists of several sets, and each set consists of several rounds. Each round is won either by Alice or by Bob, and the set ends when one of the players has won x rounds in a row. For example, if Bob won five rounds in a row and x = 2, then two sets ends.You know that Alice and Bob have already played n rounds, and you know the results of some rounds. For each x from 1 to n, calculate the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins x rounds in a row. It is possible that the last set is still not finished — in that case, you should not count it in the answer.
703	Remove Smallest You are given the array a consisting of n positive (greater than zero) integers.In one move, you can choose two indices i and j (i \ne j) such that the absolute difference between a_i and a_j is no more than one (|a_i - a_j| \le 1) and remove the smallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any of them (but exactly one).Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of  using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
704	Gifts Fixing You have n gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The i-th gift consists of a_i candies and b_i oranges.During one move, you can choose some gift 1 \le i \le n and do one of the following operations:Of course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither a_i nor b_i can become less than zero).As said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_n and b_1 = b_2 = \dots = b_n (and a_i equals b_i is ).Your task is to find the  number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.You have to answer t independent test cases.
705	Boats Competition There are n people who want to participate in a boat competition. The weight of the i-th participant is w_i. Only teams consisting of  people can participate in this competition. As an organizer, you think that it's fair to allow only teams with .So, if there are k teams (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \dots, (a_k, b_k), where a_i is the weight of the first participant of the i-th team and b_i is the weight of the second participant of the i-th team, then the condition a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 = \dots = a_k + b_k = s, where s is the total weight of  team, should be satisfied.Your task is to choose such s that the number of teams people can create is the  possible. Note that each participant can be in  team.You have to answer t independent test cases.
706	Binary String To Subsequences You are given a binary string s consisting of n zeros and ones.Your task is to divide the given string into the  number of  in such a way that  of the string belongs to exactly  and each subsequence looks like "" or "" (i.e. the subsequence should not contain two adjacent zeros or ones).Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, subsequences of "" are "", "", "", "", "", "", but not "", "" and "".You have to answer t independent test cases.
707	Yet Another Segments Subset You are given n segments on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th segment has borders [l_i; r_i]. All points x, for which l_i \le x \le r_i holds, belong to the i-th segment.Your task is to choose the  by size (the number of segments) subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.Two segments [l_i; r_i] and [l_j; r_j] are non-intersecting if they have . For example, segments [1; 2] and [3; 4], [1; 3] and [5; 5] are non-intersecting, while segments [1; 2] and [2; 3], [1; 2] and [2; 2] are intersecting.The segment [l_i; r_i] lies inside the segment [l_j; r_j] if l_j \le l_i and r_i \le r_j. For example, segments [2; 2], [2, 3], [3; 4] and [2; 4] lie inside the segment [2; 4], while [2; 5] and [1; 4] are not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
708	String Similarity A binary string is a string where each character is either  or . Two binary strings a and b of equal length are , if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} \dots s_r).You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is  to : s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].
709	RPG Protagonist You are playing one RPG from the 2010s. You are planning to raise your smithing skill, so you need as many resources as possible. So how to get resources? By stealing, of course.You decided to rob a town's blacksmith and you take a follower with you. You can carry at most p units and your follower — at most f units.In the blacksmith shop, you found cnt_s swords and cnt_w war axes. Each sword weights s units and each war axe — w units. You don't care what to take, since each of them will melt into one steel ingot.What is the maximum number of weapons (both swords and war axes) you and your follower can carry out from the shop?
710	Binary String Reconstruction Consider the following process. You have a binary string (a string where each character is either  or ) w of length n and an integer x. You build a new binary string s consisting of n characters. The i-th character of s is chosen as follows:You are given the integer x and the resulting string s. Reconstruct the original string w.
711	Zigzags You are given an array a_1, a_2 \dots a_n. Calculate the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that: 
712	Clear the Multiset You have a multiset containing several integers. Initially, it contains a_1 elements equal to 1, a_2 elements equal to 2, ..., a_n elements equal to n.You may apply two types of operations:What is the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset?
713	x-prime Substrings You are given an integer value x and a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 inclusive.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.Let f(l, r) be the sum of digits of a substring s[l..r].Let's call substring s[l_1..r_1]  if You are allowed to erase some characters from the string. If you erase a character, the two resulting parts of the string are concatenated without changing their order.What is the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no  substrings in it? If there are no  substrings in the given string s, then print 0.
714	Distance and Axis We have a point A with coordinate x = n on OX-axis. We'd like to find an  B (also on OX-axis), such that the  between the distance from O to B and the distance from A to B is equal to k.Since sometimes it's impossible to find such point B, we can, in one step, increase or decrease the coordinate of A by 1. What is the minimum number of steps we should do to make such point B exist?
715	Ternary Sequence You are given two sequences a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n and b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n. Each element of both sequences is either 0, 1 or 2. The number of elements 0, 1, 2 in the sequence a is x_1, y_1, z_1 respectively, and the number of elements 0, 1, 2 in the sequence b is x_2, y_2, z_2 respectively.You can rearrange the elements in both sequences a and b however you like. After that, let's define a sequence c as follows:c_i = \begin{cases} a_i b_i & \mbox{if }a_i > b_i \\ 0 & \mbox{if }a_i = b_i \\ -a_i b_i & \mbox{if }a_i < b_i \end{cases}You'd like to make \sum_{i=1}^n c_i (the sum of all elements of the sequence c) as large as possible. What is the maximum possible sum?
716	Mere Array  You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where all a_i are integers and greater than 0. In one operation, you can choose two different indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n). If gcd(a_i, a_j) is equal to the minimum element of the  a, you can swap a_i and a_j. gcd(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y. Now you'd like to make a non-decreasing using the operation any number of times (possibly zero). Determine if you can do this. An array a is non-decreasing if and only if a_1 \le a_2 \le \ldots \le a_n.
717	Maximum Distributed Tree You are given a tree that consists of n nodes. You should label each of its n-1 edges with an integer in such way that satisfies the following conditions: Let's define f(u,v) as the sum of the numbers on the simple path from node u to node v. Also, let \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^n f(i,j) be a  of the tree.Find the maximum possible distribution index you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.In this problem, since the number k can be large, the result of the prime factorization of k is given instead.
718	Divide Square There is a square of size 10^6 \times 10^6 on the coordinate plane with four points (0, 0), (0, 10^6), (10^6, 0), and (10^6, 10^6) as its vertices.You are going to draw segments on the plane. All segments are either horizontal or vertical and .Now you are wondering how many pieces this square divides into after drawing all segments. Write a program calculating the number of pieces of the square.
719	Reverse and Swap You are given an array a of length 2^n. You should process q queries on it. Each query has one of the following 4 types: Write a program that can quickly process given queries.
720	Fancy Fence Everybody knows that Balázs has the fanciest fence in the whole town. It's built up from N fancy sections. The sections are rectangles standing closely next to each other on the ground. The ith section has integer height h_i and integer width w_i.  We are looking for fancy rectangles on this fancy fence.  A rectangle is fancy if: 
721	Roads The government of Treeland wants to build a new road network. There are 2N cities in Treeland. The unfinished plan of the road network already contains N road segments, each of which connects two cities with a straight line. No two road segments have a common point (including their endpoints).  Your task is to determine N-1 additional road segments satisfying the following conditions: 
722	Star Trek The United Federation of Planets is an alliance of N planets, they are indexed from 1 to N. Some planets are connected by space tunnels. In a space tunnel, a starship can fly both ways really fast. There are exactly N-1 space tunnels, and we can travel from any planet to any other planet in the Federation using these tunnels.It's well known that there are D additional parallel universes. These are exact copies of our universe, they have the same planets and space tunnels. They are indexed from 1 to D (our universe has index 0). We denote the planet x in universe i by P_x^i. We can travel from one universe to another using dimension portals. For every i (0\leq i \leq D-1), we will place exactly one portal that allows us to fly from P_{A_i}^i to P_{B_i}^{i+1}, for some planet indices A_i and B_i (i.e. 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N).Once all the portals are placed, Starship Batthyány will embark on its maiden voyage. It is currently orbiting around P_1^0. Captain Ágnes and Lieutenant Gábor have decided to play the following game: they choose alternately a destination (a planet) to fly to. This planet can be in the same universe, if a space tunnel goes there, or it can be in another universe, if a portal goes there. Their aim is to visit places . That's why, once they have visited a planet P_x^i, they never go back there (but they can visit the planet x in another universe). Captain Ágnes chooses the first destination (then Gábor, then Ágnes etc.). If somebody can't choose a planet where they have not been before in his/her turn, he/she loses.Captain Ágnes and Lieutenant Gábor are both very clever: they know the locations of all tunnels and portals, and they both play optimally. For how many different placements of portals does Captain Ágnes win the game? Two placements are different if there is an index i (0\leq i \leq D-1), where the ith portal connects different pairs of planets in the two placements (i.e A_i or B_i differs).This number can be very big, so we are interested in it modulo 10^9+7.
723	The Potion of Great Power Once upon a time, in the , everyone lived on the . Each shaman had a unique identifying number i between 0 and N-1, and an altitude value H_i, representing how high he lived above ground level. The distance between two altitudes is the absolute value of their difference.All shamans lived together in peace, until one of them stole the formula of the world-famous . To cover his/her tracks, the  has put a  on the land: most inhabitants could no longer trust each other...Despite the very difficult circumstances, the  have gained the following information about the : They believe the  has whispered the formula to an . To avoid detection, both of them visited the home of one of their (respective) trusted friends. During the visit, the  whispered the formula to the  through the window. (Note: this trusted friend did not have to be home at the time. In fact, it's even possible that they visited each other's houses – shamans are weird.)Fortunately, whispers only travel short distances, so the  knows the two trusted friends visited (by the  and the ) must live very close to each other.They ask you to help with their investigation. They would like to test their suspicions: what if the  was x, the  was y, and the formula was whispered on day v? What is the smallest distance the whispered formula had to travel? That is, what is the minimum distance between the apartments of some shamans x' and y' (i.e. \min\left(\left|H_{x'} - H_{y'}\right|\right)), such that x' was a trusted friend of x and y' was a trusted friend of y on day v?They will share all their information with you, then ask you a number of questions. You need to answer each question immediately, before receiving the next one.
724	Spring cleaning Spring cleanings are probably the most boring parts of our lives, except this year, when Flóra and her mother found a dusty old tree graph under the carpet.This tree has N nodes (numbered from 1 to N), connected by N-1 edges. The edges gathered too much dust, so Flóra's mom decided to clean them. Cleaning the edges of an arbitrary tree is done by repeating the following process:   She chooses 2 different leaves (a node is a leaf if it is connected to exactly one other node by an edge), and cleans every edge lying on the shortest path between them. If this path has d edges, then the cost of cleaning this path is d.She doesn't want to harm the leaves of the tree, so she chooses every one of them . A tree is cleaned when all of its edges are cleaned. The cost of this is the sum of costs for all cleaned paths.Flóra thinks the tree they found is too small and simple, so she imagines Q variations of it. In the i-th variation, she adds a total of D_i extra leaves to the  tree: for each new leaf, she chooses a node from the  tree, and connects that node with the new leaf by an edge. Note that some nodes may stop being leaves during this step.For all these Q variations, we are interested in the minimum cost that is required to clean the tree.
725	Chess Rush The mythic world of Chess Land is a rectangular grid of squares with R rows and C columns, R being greater than or equal to C. Its rows and columns are numbered from 1 to R and 1 to C, respectively. The inhabitants of Chess Land are usually mentioned as  in everyday language, and there are 5 specific types of them roaming the land: pawns, rooks, bishops, queens and kings. Contrary to popular belief, chivalry is long dead in Chess Land, so there are no knights to be found.Each piece is unique in the way it moves around from square to square: in one step, Recently, Chess Land has become a dangerous place: pieces that are passing through the land can get captured unexpectedly by unknown forces and simply disappear. As a consequence, they would like to reach their destinations as fast (i.e. in as few moves) as possible, and they are also interested in the number of different ways it is possible for them to reach it, using the minimal number of steps – because more paths being available could mean lower chances of getting captured. Two paths are considered different if they differ in at least one visited square.For this problem, let us assume that pieces are entering Chess Land in a given column of row 1, and exit the land in a given column of row R. Your task is to answer Q questions: given the type of a piece, the column it enters row 1 and the column it must reach in row R in order to exit, compute the minimal number of moves it has to make in Chess Land, and the number of different ways it is able to do so.
726	Balanced Bitstring A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters  and . A bitstring is called k- if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of  and  characters (\frac{k}{2} of each).You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters , , and . You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every  characters in s with either  or .A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
727	Tree Tag Alice and Bob are playing a fun game of tree tag.The game is played on a tree of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. Recall that a tree on n vertices is an undirected, connected graph with n-1 edges.Initially, Alice is located at vertex a, and Bob at vertex b. They take turns alternately, and Alice makes the first move. In a move, Alice can jump to a vertex with distance  da from the current vertex. And in a move, Bob can jump to a vertex with distance  db from the current vertex. The distance between two vertices is defined as the number of edges on the unique simple path between them. In particular, either player is allowed to stay at the same vertex in a move. Note that when performing a move, a player only occupies the starting and ending vertices of their move, not the vertices between them.If after at most 10^{100} moves, Alice and Bob occupy the same vertex, then Alice is declared the winner. Otherwise, Bob wins.Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
728	Fixed Point Removal Let a_1, \ldots, a_n be an array of n positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index i such that a_i = i, and remove a_i from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).The weight of a is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove.You must answer q independent queries (x, y): after replacing the x first elements of a and the y last elements of a by n+1 (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of a?
729	Game of Pairs Consider a fixed positive integer n. Two players,  and  play a game as follows:To determine the winner of the game, we compute the sum of the numbers chosen by . If the sum of all these numbers is a multiple of 2n, then  wins. Otherwise,  wins.You are given the integer n. Your task is to decide which player you wish to play as and win the game.
730	Bricks A brick is defined as a rectangle with integer side lengths with either width 1 or height 1 (or both).There is an n\times m grid, and each cell is colored either black or white. A tiling is a way to place bricks onto the grid such that each black cell is covered by exactly one brick, and each white cell is not covered by any brick. In other words, bricks are placed on black cells only, cover all black cells, and .What is the minimum number of bricks required to make a valid tiling?
731	Permutation Forgery A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).Let p be any permutation of length n. We define the  F(p) of p as the sorted array of sums of adjacent elements in p. More formally,F(p)=\mathrm{sort}([p_1+p_2,p_2+p_3,\ldots,p_{n-1}+p_n]).For example, if n=4 and p=[1,4,2,3], then the fingerprint is given by F(p)=\mathrm{sort}([1+4,4+2,2+3])=\mathrm{sort}([5,6,5])=[5,5,6].You are given a permutation p of length n. Your task is to find a  permutation p' with the same fingerprint. Two permutations p and p' are considered different if there is some index i such that p_i \ne p'_i.
732	Array Cancellation You're given an array a of n integers, such that a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0.In one operation, you can choose two  indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n), decrement a_i by one and increment a_j by one. If i < j this operation is free, otherwise it costs one coin.How many coins do you have to spend in order to make all elements equal to 0?
733	Subset Mex Given a set of integers (it can contain equal elements).You have to split it into two subsets A and B (both of them can contain equal elements or be empty). You have to maximize the value of mex(A)+mex(B).Here mex of a set denotes the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the set. For example: The set is splitted into two subsets A and B if for any integer number x the number of occurrences of x into this set is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of x into A and the number of occurrences of x into B.
734	Maximum Product You are given an array of integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n. Find the maximum possible value of a_ia_ja_ka_la_t among all five indices (i, j, k, l, t) (i<j<k<l<t).
735	Link Cut Centroids Fishing Prince loves trees, and he especially loves trees with only one centroid. The tree is a connected graph without cycles.A vertex is a  of a tree only when you cut this vertex (remove it and remove all edges from this vertex), the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is the smallest possible.For example, the centroid of the following tree is 2, because when you cut it, the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is 2 and it can't be smaller.However, in some trees, there might be more than one centroid, for example:Both vertex 1 and vertex 2 are centroids because the size of the largest connected component is 3 after cutting each of them.Now Fishing Prince has a tree. He should cut one edge of the tree (it means to remove the edge). After that, he should add one edge. The resulting graph after these two operations should be a tree. He can add the edge that he cut.He wants the centroid of the resulting tree to be unique. Help him and find any possible way to make the operations. It can be proved, that at least one such way always exists.
736	Three Sequences You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.You have to construct two sequences of integers b and c with length n that satisfy:You have to minimize \max(b_i,c_i). In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences b and c.Also there will be q changes, the i-th change is described by three integers l,r,x. You should add x to a_l,a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r. You have to find the minimum possible value of \max(b_i,c_i) for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
737	Deleting Numbers There is an unknown integer x (1\le x\le n). You want to find x.At first, you have a set of integers \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}. You can perform the following operations no more than 10000 times:Remember that in the operation of type  a>1 must hold.Write a program, that will find the value of x.
738	Ahahahahahahahaha Alexandra has an even-length array a, consisting of 0s and 1s. The elements of the array are enumerated from 1 to n. She wants to remove  \frac{n}{2} elements (where n — length of array) in the way that alternating sum of the array will be equal 0 (i.e. a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \dotsc = 0). In other words, Alexandra wants sum of all elements at the odd positions and sum of all elements at the even positions to become equal. The elements that you remove don't have to be consecutive.For example, if she has a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] and she removes 2nd and 4th elements, a will become equal [1, 1, 0, 0] and its alternating sum is 1 - 1 + 0 - 0 = 0.Help her!
739	Big Vova Alexander is a well-known programmer. Today he decided to finally go out and play football, but with the first hit he left a dent on the new Rolls-Royce of the wealthy businessman Big Vova. Vladimir has recently opened a store on the popular online marketplace "Zmey-Gorynych", and offers Alex a job: if he shows his programming skills by solving a task, he'll work as a cybersecurity specialist. Otherwise, he'll be delivering some doubtful products for the next two years.You're given n positive integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Using each of them , you're to make such sequence b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n that sequence c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n is , where c_i=GCD(b_1,\dots,b_i) - the greatest common divisor of the first i elements of b. Alexander is really afraid of the conditions of this simple task, so he asks you to solve it.A sequence a is lexicographically smaller than a sequence b if and only if one of the following holds:
740	Chocolate Bunny We hid from you a permutation p of length n, consisting of the elements from 1 to n. You want to guess it. To do that, you can give us 2 different indices i and j, and we will reply with p_{i} \bmod p_{j} (remainder of division p_{i} by p_{j}).We have enough patience to answer at most 2 \cdot n queries, so you should fit in this constraint. Can you do it?As a reminder, a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
741	Discrete Centrifugal Jumps There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) , if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.
742	Egor in the Republic of Dagestan Egor is a famous Russian singer, rapper, actor and blogger, and finally he decided to give a concert in the sunny Republic of Dagestan.There are n cities in the republic, some of them are connected by m directed roads without any additional conditions. In other words, road system of Dagestan represents . Egor will arrive to the city 1, travel to the city n by roads along some path, give a concert and fly away.As any famous artist, Egor has lots of haters and too annoying fans, so he can travel only by safe roads. There are two types of the roads in Dagestan, black and white: black roads are safe at night only, and white roads — in the morning. Before the trip Egor's manager's going to make a schedule: for each city he'll specify it's color, black or white, and then if during the trip they visit some city, the only time they can leave it is determined by the city's color: night, if it's black, and morning, if it's white. After creating the schedule Egor chooses an available path from 1 to n, and for security reasons it has to be the shortest possible.Egor's manager likes Dagestan very much and wants to stay here as long as possible, so he asks you to make such schedule that there would be no path from 1 to n or the shortest path's length would be greatest possible.A  is one city or a sequence of roads such that for every road (excluding the first one) the city this road goes from is equal to the city previous road goes into. Egor can move only along paths consisting of safe roads only. The path length is equal to the number of roads in it. The shortest path in a graph is a path with smallest length.
743	Circle Coloring You are given three sequences: a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n; b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n; c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n.For each i, a_i \neq b_i, a_i \neq c_i, b_i \neq c_i.Find a sequence p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n, that satisfy the following conditions:In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements i,i+1 adjacent for i<n and also elements 1 and n) will have equal value.It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.
744	Arrays Sum You are given a  array of  integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Also you are given a positive integer k.You want to find m  arrays of  integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m, such that:Find the minimum possible value of m, or report that there is no possible m.
745	Discrete Acceleration There is a road with length l meters. The start of the road has coordinate 0, the end of the road has coordinate l.There are two cars, the first standing at the start of the road and the second standing at the end of the road. They will start driving simultaneously. The first car will drive from the start to the end and the second car will drive from the end to the start.Initially, they will drive with a speed of 1 meter per second. There are n flags at  coordinates a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Each time when any of two cars drives through a flag, the speed of that car increases by 1 meter per second.Find how long will it take for cars to meet (to reach the same coordinate). 
746	Searchlights There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase  a_i or  b_i, you  increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i \leq c_j and b_i \leq d_j. A configuration of robbers is  if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?
747	Avoid Rainbow Cycles You are given m sets of integers A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m; elements of these sets are integers between 1 and n, inclusive.There are two arrays of positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n. In one operation you can delete an element j from the set A_i and pay a_i + b_j coins for that.You can make several (maybe none) operations (some sets can become empty).After that, you will make an edge-colored undirected graph consisting of n vertices. For each set A_i you will add an edge (x, y) with color i for all x, y \in A_i and x < y. Some pairs of vertices can be connected with more than one edge, but such edges have different colors.You call a cycle i_1 \to e_1 \to i_2 \to e_2 \to \ldots \to i_k \to e_k \to i_1 (e_j is some edge connecting vertices i_j and i_{j+1} in this graph)  if all edges on it have different colors.Find the minimum number of coins you should pay to get a graph without rainbow cycles.
748	Two Different You are given an integer n.You should find a list of pairs (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_q, y_q) (1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n) satisfying the following condition.Let's consider some function f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} (we define \mathbb{N} as the set of positive integers). In other words, f is a function that returns a positive integer for a pair of positive integers.Let's make an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, where a_i = i initially.You will perform q operations, in i-th of them you will: In other words, you need to  change a_{x_i} and a_{y_i} to f(a_{x_i}, a_{y_i}). Note that during this process f(p, q) is always the same for a fixed pair of p and q.In the end, there should be at most two different numbers in the array a.It should be true for any function f.Find any possible list of pairs. The number of pairs should not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.
749	Yet Another Two Integers Problem You are given two integers a and b.In one move, you can choose some  k from 1 to 10 and add it to a or subtract it from a. In other words, you choose an integer k \in [1; 10] and perform a := a + k or a := a - k. You may use  values of k in different moves.Your task is to find the  number of moves required to obtain b from a.You have to answer t independent test cases.
750	Minimum Product You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a \ge x and b \ge y. You can do the following operation  n times:Your task is to find the  possible product of a and b (a \cdot b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.You have to answer t independent test cases.
751	Yet Another Array Restoration We have a secret array. You don't know this array and you have to restore it. However, you know some facts about this array:It can be proven that such an array always exists under the constraints given below.Among all possible arrays that satisfy the given conditions, we ask you to restore one which has the  maximum element. In other words, you have to minimize \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n).You have to answer t independent test cases.
752	Decrease the Sum of Digits You are given a positive integer n. In one move, you can increase n by one (i.e. make n := n + 1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of n be less than or equal to s.You have to answer t independent test cases.
753	Two Platforms There are n points on a plane. The i-th point has coordinates (x_i, y_i). You have two horizontal platforms, both of length k. Each platform can be placed anywhere on a plane but it should be placed  (on the same y-coordinate) and have . If the left border of the platform is (x, y) then the right border is (x + k, y) and all points between borders (including borders) belong to the platform.Note that platforms can share common points (overlap) and it is not necessary to place both platforms on the same y-coordinate.When you place both platforms on a plane, all points start falling down decreasing their y-coordinate. If a point collides with some platform at some moment, the point stops and is . Points which never collide with any platform are lost.Your task is to find the maximum number of points you can  if you place both platforms optimally.You have to answer t independent test cases.For better understanding, please read the  section below to see a picture for the first test case.
754	Subsequences of Length Two You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of t is 2 (i.e. this string consists only of two characters).In one move, you can choose  character of s and replace it with  lowercase Latin letter. More formally, you choose some i and replace s_i (the character at the position i) with some character from '' to ''.You want to do  k replacements in such a way that  the number of occurrences of t in s as a .Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
755	In-game Chat You have been assigned to develop a filter for bad messages in the in-game chat. A message is a string S of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters and characters ''. The message is  if the number of characters '' at the end of the string strictly greater than the number of remaining characters. For example, the string "" has three parentheses at the end, three remaining characters, and is not considered bad.
756	Fair Numbers We call a positive integer number  if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example, 102 is fair (because it is divisible by 1 and 2), but 282 is not, because it isn't divisible by 8. Given a positive integer n. Find the minimum integer x, such that n \leq x and x is fair.
757	Peaceful Rooks You are given a n \times n chessboard. Rows and columns of the board are numbered from 1 to n. Cell (x, y) lies on the intersection of column number x and row number y.Rook is a chess piece, that can in one turn move any number of cells vertically or horizontally. There are m rooks (m < n) placed on the chessboard in such a way that no pair of rooks attack each other. I.e. there are no pair of rooks that share a row or a column.In one turn you can move one of the rooks any number of cells vertically or horizontally. Additionally, it shouldn't be attacked by any other rook after movement. What is the minimum number of moves required to place all the rooks on the main diagonal?The main diagonal of the chessboard is all the cells (i, i), where 1 \le i \le n.
758	Grime Zoo Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question marks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write x angry comments for every occurrence of   and y angry comments for every occurrence of  . You should replace all the question marks with  or  in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.String b is a subsequence of string a, if it can be obtained by removing some characters from a. Two occurrences of a subsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining characters are distinct.
759	Poman Numbers You've got a string S consisting of n lowercase English letters from your friend. It turned out that this is a number written in  numerals. The poman numeral system is long forgotten. All that's left is the algorithm to transform number from poman numerals to the numeral system familiar to us. Characters of S are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Let's denote the value of S as f(S), it is defined as follows: Note that m is chosen independently on each step.Your friend thinks it is possible to get f(S) = T by choosing the right m on every step. Is he right?
760	The Thorny Path According to a legend the Hanoi Temple holds a permutation of integers from 1 to n. There are n stones of distinct colors lying in one line in front of the temple. Monks can perform the following operation on stones: choose a position i (1 \le i \le n) and cyclically shift stones at positions i, p[i], p[p[i]], .... That is, a stone from position i will move to position p[i], a stone from position p[i] will move to position p[p[i]], and so on, a stone from position j, such that p[j] = i, will move to position i.Each day the monks must obtain a new arrangement of stones using an arbitrary number of these operations. When all possible arrangements will have been obtained, the world will end. You are wondering, what if some elements of the permutation could be swapped just before the beginning? How many days would the world last?You want to get a permutation that will allow the world to last as long as possible, using the minimum number of exchanges of two elements of the permutation.Two arrangements of stones are considered different if there exists a position i such that the colors of the stones on that position are different in these arrangements.
761	Finding Sasuke Naruto has sneaked into the Orochimaru's lair and is now looking for Sasuke. There are T rooms there. Every room has a door into it, each door can be described by the number n of seals on it and their integer energies a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. All energies a_i are  and do not exceed 100 by absolute value. Also, .In order to open a door, Naruto must find such n seals with integer energies b_1, b_2, ..., b_n that the following equality holds: a_{1} \cdot b_{1} + a_{2} \cdot b_{2} + ... + a_{n} \cdot b_{n} = 0. All b_i must  as well as a_i are, and also  by absolute value. Please find required seals for every room there.
762	A New Technique All techniques in the ninja world consist of hand seals. At the moment Naruto is learning a new technique, which consists of n\cdot m different seals, denoted by distinct numbers. All of them were written in an n\times m table.The table is lost now. Naruto managed to remember elements of each row from left to right, and elements of each column from top to bottom, but he doesn't remember the order of rows and columns. Please restore the table consistent with this data so that Naruto will be able to learn the new technique.
763	Perform Easily After battling Shikamaru, Tayuya decided that her flute is too predictable, and replaced it with a guitar. The guitar has 6 strings and an infinite number of frets numbered from 1. Fretting the fret number j on the i-th string produces the note a_{i} + j.Tayuya wants to play a melody of n notes. Each note can be played on different string-fret combination. The easiness of performance depends on the difference between the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets. The less this difference is, the easier it is to perform the technique. Please determine the minimal possible difference.For example, if a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], and the sequence of notes is 4, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13 (corresponding to the second example), we can play the first note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7, as shown on the picture.
764	Shurikens Tenten runs a weapon shop for ninjas. Today she is willing to sell n shurikens which cost 1, 2, ..., n ryo (local currency). During a day, Tenten will place the shurikens onto the showcase, which is empty at the beginning of the day. Her job is fairly simple: sometimes Tenten places another shuriken (from the available shurikens) on the showcase, and sometimes a ninja comes in and buys a shuriken from the showcase. Since ninjas are thrifty, they always buy the  shuriken from the showcase.Tenten keeps a record for all events, and she ends up with a list of the following types of records:Today was a lucky day, and all shurikens were bought. Now Tenten wonders if her list is consistent, and what could be a possible order of placing the shurikens on the showcase. Help her to find this out!
765	Solo mid Oracle Meka-Naruto plays a computer game. His character has the following ability: given an enemy hero, deal a instant damage to him, and then heal that enemy b health points at the end of every second, for exactly c seconds, starting one second after the ability is used. That means that if the ability is used at time t, the enemy's health decreases by a at time t, and then increases by b at time points t + 1, t + 2, ..., t + c due to this ability.The ability has a cooldown of d seconds, i. e. if Meka-Naruto uses it at time moment t, next time he can use it is the time t + d. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.The effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under k spells gets k\cdot b amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.Now Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every d seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points become 0 or less. Assume that the enemy's health is not affected in any way other than by Meka-Naruto's character ability. What is the maximal number of health points the enemy can have so that Meka-Naruto is able to kill them?
766	Roads and Ramen In the Land of Fire there are n villages and n-1 bidirectional road, and there is a path between any pair of villages by roads. There are only two types of roads: stone ones and sand ones. Since the Land of Fire is constantly renovating, every morning workers choose a single road and flip its type (so it becomes a stone road if it was a sand road and vice versa). Also everyone here loves ramen, that's why every morning a ramen pavilion is set in the middle of every  road, and at the end of each day all the pavilions are removed.For each of the following m days, after another road is flipped, Naruto and Jiraiya choose a simple path — that is, a route which starts in a village and ends in a (possibly, the same) village, and doesn't contain any road twice. Since Naruto and Jiraiya also love ramen very much, they buy a single cup of ramen on each stone road and one of them eats it. Since they don't want to offend each other, they only choose routes where they can eat equal number of ramen cups. Since they both like traveling, they choose any longest possible path. After every renovation find the maximal possible length of a path (that is, the number of roads in it) they can follow.
767	Prison Break There is a prison that can be represented as a rectangular matrix with n rows and m columns. Therefore, there are n \cdot m prison cells. There are also n \cdot m prisoners, one in each prison cell. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column as (i, j).There's a secret tunnel in the cell (r, c), that the prisoners will use to escape! However, to avoid the risk of getting caught, they will escape at night.Before the night, every prisoner is in his own cell. When night comes, they can start moving to adjacent cells. Formally, in one second, a prisoner located in cell (i, j) can move to cells ( i - 1 , j ) , ( i + 1 , j ) , ( i , j - 1 ) , or ( i , j + 1 ), as long as the target cell is inside the prison. They can also choose to stay in cell (i, j).The prisoners want to know the minimum number of seconds needed so that every prisoner can arrive to cell ( r , c ) if they move optimally. Note that there can be any number of prisoners in the same cell at the same time. 
768	Repainting Street There is a street with n houses in a line, numbered from 1 to n. The house i is initially painted in color c_i. The street is considered beautiful if all houses are painted in the same color. Tom, the painter, is in charge of making the street beautiful. Tom's painting capacity is defined by an integer, let's call it k.On one day, Tom can do the following repainting process that consists of two steps: Note that in the same day Tom can use different colors to repaint different houses.Tom wants to know the minimum number of days needed to repaint the street so that it becomes beautiful.
769	Bouncing Ball You're creating a game level for some mobile game. The level should contain some number of cells aligned in a row from left to right and numbered with consecutive integers starting from 1, and in each cell you can either put a platform or leave it empty.In order to pass a level, a player must throw a ball from the left so that it first lands on a platform in the cell p, then bounces off it, then bounces off a platform in the cell (p + k), then a platform in the cell (p + 2k), and so on every k-th platform until it goes farther than the last cell. If any of these cells has no platform, you can't pass the level with these p and k.You already have some level pattern a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n, where a_i = 0 means there is no platform in the cell i, and a_i = 1 means there is one. You want to modify it so that the level can be passed with given p and k. In x seconds you can add a platform in some empty cell. In y seconds you can remove the first cell completely, reducing the number of cells by one, and renumerating the other cells keeping their order. You can't do any other operation. You  reduce the number of cells to less than p.What is the minimum number of seconds you need to make this level passable with given p and k?
770	XOR-gun Arkady owns a  array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. You are jealous of its beauty and want to destroy this property. You have a so-called  that you can use one or more times.In one step you can select two  elements of the array, let's say x and y, remove them from the array and insert the integer x \oplus y on their place, where \oplus denotes the . Note that the length of the array decreases by one after the operation. You can't perform this operation when the length of the array reaches one.For example, if the array is [2, 5, 6, 8], you can select 5 and 6 and replace them with 5 \oplus 6 = 3. The array becomes [2, 3, 8].You want the array no longer be non-decreasing. What is the minimum number of steps needed? If the array stays non-decreasing no matter what you do, print -1.
771	New Game Plus! Wabbit is playing a game with n bosses numbered from 1 to n. The bosses can be fought in any order. Each boss needs to be defeated . There is a parameter called  which is initially 0.When the i-th boss is defeated, the current  is added to Wabbit's score, and then the value of the  increases by the point increment c_i. Note that c_i can be negative, which means that other bosses now give fewer points.However, Wabbit has found a glitch in the game. At any point in time, he can reset the playthrough and start a New Game Plus playthrough. This will set the current  to 0, while all defeated bosses remain defeated. The current score is also saved and does  reset to zero after this operation. This glitch can be used  k times. He can reset after defeating any number of bosses (including before or after defeating all of them), and he also can reset the game several times in a row without defeating any boss.Help Wabbit determine the maximum score he can obtain if he has to defeat  n bosses.
772	Cakes for Clones You live on a number line. You are initially (at time moment t = 0) located at point x = 0. There are n events of the following type: at time t_i a small cake appears at coordinate x_i. To collect this cake, you have to be at this coordinate at this point, otherwise the cake spoils immediately. No two cakes appear at the same time and no two cakes appear at the same coordinate.You can move with the speed of 1 length unit per one time unit. Also, at any moment you can create a clone of yourself at the same point where you are located. The clone can't move, but it will collect the cakes appearing at this position for you. The clone  when you create another clone. If the new clone is created at time moment t, the old clone can collect the cakes that appear before or at the time moment t, and the new clone can collect the cakes that appear at or after time moment t.Can you collect all the cakes (by yourself or with the help of clones)?
773	k-Amazing Numbers You are given an array a consisting of n integers numbered from 1 to n.Let's define the k-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length k (recall that a subsegment of a of length k is a contiguous part of a containing exactly k elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length k for some value of k, then the k-amazing number is -1.For each k from 1 to n calculate the k-amazing number of the array a.
774	Make Them Equal You are given an array a consisting of n  integers, numbered from 1 to n. You can perform the following operation no more than 3n times:After each operation, all elements of the array should be .Can you find a sequence of no more than 3n operations after which all elements of the array are equal?
775	XOR Inverse You are given an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. You have to choose a non-negative integer x and form a new array b of size n according to the following rule: for all i from 1 to n, b_i = a_i \oplus x (\oplus denotes the operation ).An inversion in the b array is a pair of integers i and j such that 1 \le i < j \le n and b_i > b_j.You should choose x in such a way that the number of inversions in b is minimized. If there are several options for x — output the smallest one.
776	Graph and Queries You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. Initially there is a single integer written on every vertex: the vertex i has p_i written on it. All p_i are distinct integers from 1 to n.You have to process q queries of two types:Note that, in a query of the first type, it is possible that all vertices reachable from v have 0 written on them. In this case, u is not explicitly defined, but since the selection of u does not affect anything, you can choose any vertex reachable from v and print its value (which is 0). 
777	Split One day,  decided to play around with arrays and came up with the following problem:You are given an array a, which consists of n positive integers. The array is numerated 1 through n. You execute the following procedure :Find and print  value of |b| (size of b) which can be achieved at the end of the procedure. It can be shown that under the given constraints there is at least one way to construct b.
778	Showing Off Another dull quarantine day was going by when  decided to start researching matrices of size n \times m. The rows are numerated 1 through n from top to bottom, and the columns are numerated 1 through m from left to right. The cell in the i-th row and j-th column is denoted as (i, j).For each cell (i, j)  had two values: Let us call a cell (i_2, j_2)  from (i_1, j_1), if, starting from (i_1, j_1) and repeatedly moving to the adjacent cell according to our current direction, we will, sooner or later, visit (i_2, j_2).  decided to create another matrix from the existing two. For a cell (i, j), let us denote S_{i, j} as a set of all reachable cells from it (including (i, j) itself). Then, the value at the cell (i, j) in the new matrix will be equal to the sum of costs of all cells in S_{i, j}. After quickly computing the new matrix,  immediately sent it to his friends. However, he did not save any of the initial matrices! Help him to restore any two valid matrices, which produce the current one.
779	Copy-paste — That'll do it.  is a powerful magician. He has got n piles of candies, the i-th pile initially contains a_i candies.  can cast a  spell as follows:  can cast this spell any number of times he wants to — but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than k candies, he loses his magic power. What is the maximum number of times  can cast the spell without losing his power?
780	Two Arrays  has an array a consisting of n non-negative integers, and an unlucky integer T.Let's denote the misfortune of array b having length m as f(b) — the number of pairs of integers (i, j) such that 1 \le i < j \le m and b_i + b_j = T.  has to paint each element of a into one of two colors, white and black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then create two arrays c and d so that all white elements belong to c, and all black elements belong to d .  wants to paint the elements in such a way that f(c) + f(d) is  possible.For example:Help  to paint the array optimally!
781	Buying Torches You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft k torches. One torch can be crafted using .Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:During one trade, you can use  of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least k torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.You have to answer t independent test cases.
782	Negative Prefixes You are given an array a, consisting of n integers.Each position i (1 \le i \le n) of the array is either locked or unlocked. You can take the values on the unlocked positions, rearrange them in any order and place them back into the unlocked positions. You are not allowed to remove any values, add the new ones or rearrange the values on the locked positions. You are allowed to leave the values in the same order as they were.For example, let a = [-1, 1, \underline{3}, 2, \underline{-2}, 1, -4, \underline{0}], the underlined positions are locked. You can obtain the following arrays: Let p be a sequence of prefix sums of the array a after the rearrangement. So p_1 = a_1, p_2 = a_1 + a_2, p_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3, \dots, p_n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n.Let k be the maximum j (1 \le j \le n) such that p_j < 0. If there are no j such that p_j < 0, then k = 0.Your goal is to rearrange the values in such a way that k is minimum possible.Output the array a after the rearrangement such that the value k for it is minimum possible. If there are multiple answers then print any of them.
783	Mortal Kombat Tower You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.During one session, either you or your friend can kill  bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. .Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.Your task is to find the  number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.For example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:You have to answer t independent test cases.
784	Trash Problem Vova decided to clean his room. The room can be represented as the coordinate axis OX. There are n piles of trash in the room, coordinate of the i-th pile is the integer p_i. All piles have  coordinates.Let's define a  as the following process. The goal of this process is to collect  the piles in  different x coordinates. To achieve this goal, Vova can do several (possibly, zero) moves. During one move, he can choose some x and move  from x to x+1 or x-1 using his broom. Note that he can't choose how many piles he will move.Also, there are two types of queries:Note that it is possible that there are zero piles of trash in the room at some moment.Vova wants to know the  number of moves he can spend if he wants to do a  before any queries. He also wants to know this number of moves after applying each query. Queries are applied in the given order. Note that the  doesn't actually happen and doesn't change the state of piles. It is only used to calculate the number of moves.For better understanding, please read the  section below to see an explanation for the first example.
785	Expected Damage You are playing a computer game. In this game, you have to fight n monsters.To defend from monsters, you need a shield. Each shield has two parameters: its current durability a and its defence rating b. Each monster has only one parameter: its strength d.When you fight a monster with strength d while having a shield with current durability a and defence b, there are three possible outcomes:The i-th monster has strength d_i, and you will fight each of the monsters exactly once, in some random order (all n! orders are equiprobable). You have to consider m different shields, the i-th shield has initial durability a_i and defence rating b_i. For each shield, calculate the expected amount of damage you will receive if you take this shield and fight the given n monsters in random order.
786	Equal Product You are given four integers n, m, l and r.Let's name a tuple (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) as  if: Find any good tuple .
787	Digit Game Everyone knows that agents in Valorant decide, who will play as attackers, and who will play as defenders. To do that Raze and Breach decided to play t matches of a digit game...In each of t matches of the digit game, a positive integer is generated. It consists of n digits. The digits of this integer are numerated from 1 to n from the highest-order digit to the lowest-order digit. After this integer is announced, the match starts.Agents play in turns. Raze starts. In one turn an agent can choose any unmarked digit and mark it. Raze can choose digits on odd positions, but can not choose digits on even positions. Breach can choose digits on even positions, but can not choose digits on odd positions. The match ends, when there is only one unmarked digit left. If the single last digit is odd, then Raze wins, else Breach wins.It can be proved, that before the end of the match (for every initial integer with n digits) each agent has an ability to make a turn, i.e. there is at least one unmarked digit, that stands on a position of required parity.For each of t matches find out, which agent wins, if both of them want to win and play optimally.
788	Stairs Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She likes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she decided to craft staircases.A staircase is a squared figure that consists of square cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a staircase has n stairs, then it is made of n columns, the first column is 1 cell high, the second column is 2 cells high, \ldots, the n-th column if n cells high. The lowest cells of all stairs must be in the same row.A staircase with n stairs is called nice, if it may be covered by n  squares made of cells. All squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase.Find out the maximal number of  nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than x cells, . No cell can be used more than once.
789	Killjoy A new agent called Killjoy invented a virus COVID-2069 that infects accounts on Codeforces. Each account has a rating, described by  (it can possibly be negative or very large).Killjoy's account is already infected and has a rating equal to x. Its rating is constant. There are n accounts except hers, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th account's initial rating is a_i. Any infected account (initially the only infected account is Killjoy's) instantly infects any uninfected account if their ratings are equal. This can happen at the beginning (before any rating changes) and after each contest. If an account is infected, it can not be healed.Contests are regularly held on Codeforces. In each contest, any of these n accounts (including infected ones) can participate. Killjoy can't participate. After each contest ratings are changed this way: each participant's rating is changed by an integer, but the sum of all changes must be equal to zero. New ratings can be any integer.Find out the minimal number of contests needed to infect all accounts. You can choose which accounts will participate in each contest and how the ratings will change.It can be proven that all accounts can be infected in some finite number of contests.
790	Decryption An agent called Cypher is decrypting a message, that contains a  n. All divisors of n, which are greater than 1, are placed in a circle. Cypher can choose the initial order of numbers in the circle.In one move Cypher can choose two adjacent numbers in a circle and insert their  between them. He can do that move as many times as needed.A message is decrypted, if every two adjacent numbers are not coprime. Note that for such constraints it's always possible to decrypt the message.Find the minimal number of moves that Cypher should do to decrypt the message, and show the initial order of numbers in the circle for that.
791	Rain of Fire There are n detachments on the surface, numbered from 1 to n, the i-th detachment is placed in a point with coordinates (x_i, y_i). All detachments are placed in different points.Brimstone should visit each detachment at least once. You can choose the detachment where Brimstone starts.To move from one detachment to another he should first choose one of four directions of movement (up, right, left or down) and then start moving with the constant speed of one unit interval in a second until he comes to a detachment. After he reaches an arbitrary detachment, he can repeat the same process.Each t seconds an orbital strike covers the whole surface, so at that moment Brimstone should be in a point where some detachment is located. He can stay with any detachment as long as needed.Brimstone is a good commander, that's why he can create  detachment and place it in any empty point with integer coordinates he wants before his trip. Keep in mind that Brimstone will need to visit this detachment, too.Help Brimstone and find such minimal t that it is possible to check each detachment. If there is no such t report about it.
792	Cubes Sorting Oh, that's funny, is it? Oh it's funny? Because we've been at this for twelve hours and you haven't solved it either, so I don't know why you're laughing. You've got one hour! Solve it! Wheatley decided to try to make a test chamber. He made a nice test chamber, but there was only one detail absent — cubes.For completing the chamber Wheatley needs n cubes. i-th cube has a volume a_i.Wheatley has to place cubes in such a way that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume. Formally, for each i>1, a_{i-1} \le a_i must hold.To achieve his goal, Wheatley can exchange two  cubes. It means that for any i>1 you can exchange cubes on positions i-1 and i.But there is a problem: Wheatley is very impatient. If Wheatley needs more than \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}-1 exchange operations, he won't do this boring work.Wheatly wants to know: can cubes be sorted under this conditions?
793	Rock and Lever You must block the canal. With a rock. I will not give the rock to you." Danik urgently needs rock and lever! Obviously, the easiest way to get these things is to ask Hermit Lizard for them.Hermit Lizard agreed to give Danik the lever. But to get a stone, Danik needs to solve the following task.You are given a positive integer n, and an array a of positive integers. The task is to calculate the number of such pairs (i,j) that i<j and a_i \& a_j \ge a_i \oplus a_j, where \& denotes the , and \oplus denotes the .Danik has solved this task. But can you solve it?
794	Rescue Nibel! Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
795	Battle Lemmings A lighthouse keeper Peter commands an army of n battle lemmings. He ordered his army to stand in a line and numbered the lemmings from 1 to n from left to right. Some of the lemmings hold shields. Each lemming cannot hold more than one shield.The more protected Peter's army is, the better. To calculate the  of the army, he finds the number of protected pairs of lemmings, that is such pairs that both lemmings in the pair don't hold a shield, but there is a lemming with a shield between them.Now it's time to prepare for defence and increase the protection of the army. To do this, Peter can give orders. He chooses a lemming with a shield and gives him one of the two orders: In one second Peter can give exactly one order.It's not clear how much time Peter has before the defence. So he decided to determine the maximal value of army protection for each k from 0 to \frac{n(n-1)}2, if he gives no more that k orders. Help Peter to calculate it!
796	XORwice Tzuyu gave Sana two integers a and b and a really important quest.In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (a \oplus x) + (b \oplus x) for any given x, where \oplus denotes the . 
797	Putting Bricks in the Wall Roger Waters has a square grid of size n\times n and he wants to traverse his grid from the upper left (1,1) corner to the lower right corner (n,n). Waters can move from a square to any other square adjacent by a side, as long as he is still in the grid. Also except for the cells (1,1) and (n,n) every cell has a value 0 or 1 in it.Before starting his traversal he will pick either a 0 or a 1 and will be able to only go to cells values in which are equal to the digit he chose. The starting and finishing cells (1,1) and (n,n) are exempt from this rule, he may go through them regardless of picked digit. Because of this the cell (1,1) takes value the letter '' and the cell (n,n) takes value the letter ''.For example, in the first example test case, he can go from (1, 1) to (n, n) by using the zeroes on this path: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)The rest of the band (Pink Floyd) wants Waters to not be able to do his traversal, so while he is not looking they will  in the grid (from 0 to 1 or vice versa). They are afraid they will not be quick enough and asked for your help in choosing the cells. .We can show that there always exists a solution for the given constraints.Also note that Waters will pick his digit of the traversal after the band has changed his grid, so he must not be able to reach (n,n) no matter what digit he picks.
798	Palindromifier Ringo found a string s of length n in his . The string contains only lowercase letters from the English alphabet. As Ringo and his friends love palindromes, he would like to turn the string s into a palindrome by applying two types of operations to the string. The first operation allows him to choose i (2 \le i \le n-1) and to append the substring s_2s_3 \ldots s_i (i - 1 characters) reversed to the front of s.The second operation allows him to choose i (2 \le i \le n-1) and to append the substring s_i s_{i + 1}\ldots s_{n - 1} (n - i characters) reversed to the end of s.Note that characters in the string in this problem are indexed from 1.For example suppose s=. If he performs the first operation with i=3 then he appends  to the front of s and the result will be . Performing the second operation on the resulted string with i=5 will yield .Your task is to help Ringo make the entire string a palindrome by applying any of the two operations (in total) . It is guaranteed that under these constraints there always is a solution. Also note you do not have to minimize neither the number of operations applied, nor the length of the resulting string, but they have to fit into the constraints.
799	Hexagons Consider a hexagonal tiling of the plane as on the picture below.Nicks wishes to go from the cell marked (0, 0) to a certain cell given by the coordinates. She may go from a hexagon to any of its six neighbors you want, but there is a cost associated with each of them. The costs depend only on the direction in which you travel. Going from (0, 0) to (1, 1) will take the exact same cost as going from (-2, -1) to (-1, 0). The costs are given in the input in the order c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6 as in the picture below.Print the smallest cost of a path from the origin which has coordinates (0, 0) to the given cell.
800	Swedish Heroes While playing yet another strategy game, Mans has recruited n , whose powers which can be represented as an array a.Unfortunately, not all of those mighty heroes were created as capable as he wanted, so that he decided to do something about it. In order to accomplish his goal, he can pick two consecutive heroes, with powers a_i and a_{i+1}, remove them and insert a hero with power -(a_i+a_{i+1}) back in the same position. For example if the array contains the elements [5, 6, 7, 8], he can pick 6 and 7 and get [5, -(6+7), 8] = [5, -13, 8].After he will perform this operation n-1 times, Mans will end up having only one hero. He wants his power to be as big as possible. What's the largest possible power he can achieve?
801	Fence Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.
802	Nice Matrix A matrix of size n \times m is called nice, if all rows and columns of the matrix are palindromes. A sequence of integers (a_1, a_2, \dots , a_k) is a palindrome, if for any integer i (1 \le i \le k) the equality a_i = a_{k - i + 1} holds.Sasha owns a matrix a of size n \times m. In one operation he can increase or decrease any number in the matrix by one. Sasha wants to make the matrix nice. He is interested what is the minimum number of operations he needs.Help him!
803	Bargain Sometimes it is not easy to come to an agreement in a bargain. Right now Sasha and Vova can't come to an agreement: Sasha names a price as high as possible, then Vova wants to remove as many digits from the price as possible. In more details, Sasha names some integer price n, Vova removes a non-empty substring of (consecutive) digits from the price, the remaining digits close the gap, and the resulting integer is the price.For example, is Sasha names 1213121, Vova can remove the substring 1312, and the result is 121.It is allowed for result to contain leading zeros. If Vova removes all digits, the price is considered to be 0.Sasha wants to come up with some constraints so that Vova can't just remove all digits, but he needs some arguments supporting the constraints. To start with, he wants to compute the sum of all possible resulting prices after Vova's move.Help Sasha to compute this sum. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
804	Returning Home Yura has been walking for some time already and is planning to return home. He needs to get home as fast as possible. To do this, Yura can use the instant-movement locations around the city.Let's represent the city as an area of n \times n square blocks. Yura needs to move from the block with coordinates (s_x,s_y) to the block with coordinates (f_x,f_y). In one minute Yura can move to any neighboring by side block; in other words, he can move in four directions. Also, there are m instant-movement locations in the city. Their coordinates are known to you and Yura. Yura can move to an instant-movement location in no time if he is located in a block with the same coordinate x or with the same coordinate y as the location.Help Yura to find the smallest time needed to get home.
805	Minlexes Some time ago Lesha found an entertaining string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Lesha immediately developed an unique algorithm for this string and shared it with you. The algorithm is as follows.Lesha chooses an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of pairs on positions (i, i + 1) in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied: Lesha is interested in the lexicographically smallest strings he can obtain by applying the algorithm to the suffixes of the given string.
806	Boring Queries Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array a of length n. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes q boring queries. Each query consists of two integers x and y. Before answering a query, the bounds l and r for this query are calculated: l = (last + x) \bmod n + 1, r = (last + y) \bmod n + 1, where last is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and \bmod is the remainder operation. Whenever l > r, they are swapped.After Vladik computes l and r for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment [l; r] of the initial array a modulo 10^9 + 7. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!
807	Valuable Paper The pandemic is upon us, and the world is in shortage of the most important resource: toilet paper. As one of the best prepared nations for this crisis, BubbleLand promised to help all other world nations with this valuable resource. To do that, the country will send airplanes to other countries carrying toilet paper.In BubbleLand, there are N toilet paper factories, and N airports. Because of how much it takes to build a road, and of course legal issues, every factory must send paper to only one airport, and every airport can only take toilet paper from one factory.Also, a road can't be built between all airport-factory pairs, again because of legal issues. Every possible road has number d given, number of days it takes to build that road.Your job is to choose N factory-airport pairs, such that if the country starts building all roads at the same time, it takes the least amount of days to complete them.
808	Dušan's Railway As you may already know, Dušan is keen on playing with railway models. He has a big map with cities that are connected with railways. His map can be seen as a graph where vertices are cities and the railways connecting them are the edges. So far, the graph corresponding to his map is a tree. As you already know, a tree is a connected acyclic undirected graph.He is curious to find out whether his railway can be optimized somehow. He wants to add so-called , which are also railways connecting pairs of cities. This shortcut will  the railways in the unique path in the tree between the pair of cities it connects. Since Dušan doesn't like repeating the railways, he has also defined good paths in his newly obtained network (notice that after adding the shortcuts, his graph is no more a tree). He calls a path , if no edge appears more than once, either as a regular railway edge or as an edge represented by some shortcut (Every shortcut in a good path has length 1, but uses up all the edges it represents - they can't appear again in that path). Having defined good paths, he defines  between two cities to be the length of the shortest good path between them. Finally, the  of his network is the largest good distance between any two cities.Now he is curious to find out whether it is possible to achieve shortcutting diameter less or equal than k, while adding as few shortcuts as possible.
809	5G Antenna Towers After making a strategic plan with carriers for expansion of mobile network throughout the whole country, the government decided to cover rural areas with the last generation of 5G network.Since 5G antenna towers will be built in the area of mainly private properties, the government needs an easy way to find information about landowners for each  partially or fully contained in the planned building area. The planned building area is represented as a rectangle with sides width and height.Every 5G antenna tower occupies a  with a center in (x,y) and radius r. There is a database of Geodetic Institute containing information about each property. Each property is defined with its  and  represented as an array of (x,y) points in the counter-clockwise direction. Your task is to build an IT system which can handle queries of type (x, y, r) in which (x,y) represents a circle center, while r represents its radius. The IT system should return the  of properties that need to be acquired for the building of a tower so that the government can estimate the price. Furthermore, the system should return a list of  of these properties (so that the owners can be contacted for land acquisition).A property needs to be acquired if the circle of the antenna tower is intersecting or touching it. 
810	Coins A famous gang of pirates, Sea Dogs, has come back to their hideout from one of their extravagant plunders. They want to split their treasure fairly amongst themselves, that is why You, their trusted financial advisor, devised a game to help them:All of them take a sit at their round table, some of them with the golden coins they have just stolen. At each iteration of the game if one of them has equal or more than 2 coins, he is eligible to the splitting and he gives one coin to each pirate sitting next to him. If there are more candidates (pirates with equal or more than 2 coins) then  are the one that chooses which  of them will do the splitting in that iteration. The game ends when there are no more candidates eligible to do the splitting. Pirates can call it a day, only when the game ends. Since they are beings with a finite amount of time at their disposal, they would prefer if the game that they are playing can end after finite iterations, and if so, they call it a . On the other hand, if no matter how  do the splitting, the game cannot end in finite iterations, they call it a . Can You help them figure out before they start playing if the game will be good or bad?
811	Arena of Greed Lately, Mr. Chanek frequently plays the game . As the name implies, the game's goal is to find the greediest of them all, who will then be crowned king of Compfestnesia.The game is played by two people taking turns, where Mr. Chanek takes the first turn. Initially, there is a treasure chest containing N gold coins. The game ends if there are no more gold coins in the chest. In each turn, the players can make one of the following moves:Both players will try to maximize the number of coins they have. Mr. Chanek asks your help to find the maximum number of coins he can get at the end of the game if both he and the opponent plays optimally.
812	Blue and Red of Our Faculty! It's our faculty's 34th anniversary! To celebrate this great event, the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia (Fasilkom), held CPC - Coloring Pavements Competition. The gist of CPC is two players color the predetermined routes of Fasilkom in Blue and Red. There are N Checkpoints and M undirected predetermined routes. Routes i connects checkpoint U_i and V_i, for (1 \le i \le M). It is guaranteed that any pair of checkpoints are connected by using one or more routes.The rules of CPC is as follows: Chaneka is interested in participating. However, she does not want to waste much energy. So, She is only interested in the number of final configurations of the routes after each round. Turns out, counting this is also exhausting, so Chaneka asks you to figure this out!Two final configurations are considered different if there is a route U in a different color in the two configurations.
813	Captain of Knights Mr. Chanek just won the national chess tournament and got a huge chessboard of size N \times M. Bored with playing conventional chess, Mr. Chanek now defines a function F(X, Y), which denotes the minimum number of moves to move a knight from square (1, 1) to square (X, Y). It turns out finding F(X, Y) is too simple, so Mr. Chanek defines:G(X, Y) = \sum_{i=X}^{N} \sum_{j=Y}^{M} F(i, j)Given X and Y, you are tasked to find G(X, Y).A knight can move from square (a, b) to square (a', b') if and only if |a - a'| > 0, |b - b'| > 0, and |a - a'| + |b - b'| = 3. Of course, the knight cannot leave the chessboard.
814	Danger of Mad Snakes Mr. Chanek The Ninja is one day tasked with a mission to handle mad snakes that are attacking a site. Now, Mr. Chanek already arrived at the hills where the destination is right below these hills. The mission area can be divided into a grid of size 1000 \times 1000 squares. There are N mad snakes on the site, the i'th mad snake is located on square (X_i, Y_i) and has a danger level B_i.Mr. Chanek is going to use the Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan that he learned from Lord Seventh to complete this mission. His attack strategy is as follows:Now Mr. Chanek is curious, what is the sum of scores for every possible attack strategy? Because this number can be huge, Mr. Chanek only needs the output modulo 10^9 + 7.
815	Excitation of Atoms Mr. Chanek is currently participating in a science fair that is popular in town. He finds an exciting puzzle in the fair and wants to solve it.There are N atoms numbered from 1 to N. These atoms are especially quirky. Initially, each atom is in normal state. Each atom can be in an excited. Exciting atom i requires D_i energy. When atom i is excited, it will give A_i energy. You can excite any number of atoms (including zero).These atoms also form a peculiar one-way bond. For each i, (1 \le i < N), if atom i is excited, atom E_i will also be excited at no cost. Initially, E_i = i+1. Note that atom N cannot form a bond to any atom.Mr. Chanek must change  K bonds. Exactly K times, Mr. Chanek chooses an atom i, (1 \le i < N) and changes E_i to a different value other than i and the current E_i. Note that an atom's bond can remain unchanged or changed more than once. Help Mr. Chanek determine the maximum energy that he can achieve! You must first change  K bonds before you can start exciting atoms.
816	Flamingoes of Mystery Mr. Chanek wants to buy a flamingo to accompany his chickens on his farm. Before going to the pet shop, Mr. Chanek stops at an animal festival to have fun. It turns out there is a carnival game with a flamingo as the prize.There are N mysterious cages, which are numbered from 1 to N. Cage i has A_i (0 \le A_i \le 10^3) flamingoes inside (1 \le i \le N). However, the game master keeps the number of flamingoes inside a secret. To win the flamingo, Mr. Chanek must guess the number of flamingoes in each cage.Coincidentally, Mr. Chanek has N coins. Each coin can be used to ask once, what is the total number of flamingoes inside cages numbered L to R inclusive? With L < R.
817	Floor Number Vasya goes to visit his classmate Petya. Vasya knows that Petya's apartment number is n. There is only one entrance in Petya's house and the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains 2 apartments, every other floor contains x apartments each. Apartments are numbered starting from one, from the first floor. I.e. apartments on the first floor have numbers 1 and 2, apartments on the second floor have numbers from 3 to (x + 2), apartments on the third floor have numbers from (x + 3) to (2 \cdot x + 2), and so on.Your task is to find the number of floor on which Petya lives. Assume that the house is always high enough to fit at least n apartments.You have to answer t independent test cases.
818	Symmetric Matrix Masha has n types of tiles of size 2 \times 2. Each cell of the tile contains one integer. Masha has an  of tiles of each type.Masha decides to construct the square of size m \times m consisting of the given tiles. This square also has to be a , and each cell of this square has to be covered with exactly one tile cell, and also sides of tiles should be parallel to the sides of the square. All placed tiles cannot intersect with each other. Also, each tile should lie inside the square. See the picture in Notes section for better understanding.Symmetric with respect to the main diagonal matrix is such a square s that for each pair (i, j) the condition s[i][j] = s[j][i] holds. I.e. it is true that the element written in the i-row and j-th column equals to the element written in the j-th row and i-th column.Your task is to determine if Masha can construct a square of size m \times m which is a symmetric matrix and consists of tiles she has. Masha can use any number of tiles of each type she has to construct the square. Note that she  rotate tiles, she can only place them in the orientation they have in the input.You have to answer t independent test cases.
819	Increase and Copy Initially, you have the array a consisting of one element 1 (a = [1]).In one move, you can do one of the following things:For example, consider the sequence of five moves:Your task is to find the  number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least n.You have to answer t independent test cases.
820	Non-zero Segments Kolya got an integer array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, but Kolya doesn't like 0, so the array doesn't contain any zeros.Kolya doesn't like that the sum of some subsegments of his array can be 0. The subsegment is some consecutive segment of elements of the array. You have to help Kolya and change his array in such a way that it doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum 0. To reach this goal, you can insert any integers between any pair of adjacent elements of the array (integers can be really any: positive, negative, 0, any by absolute value, even such a huge that they can't be represented in most standard programming languages).Your task is to find the minimum number of integers you have to insert into Kolya's array in such a way that the resulting array doesn't contain any subsegments with the sum 0.
821	Rock, Paper, Scissors Alice and Bob have decided to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The game consists of several rounds, each round is independent of each other. In each round, both players show one of the following things at the same time: rock, paper or scissors. If both players showed the same things then the round outcome is a draw. Otherwise, the following rules applied:Alice and Bob decided to play exactly n rounds of the game described above. Alice decided to show rock a_1 times, show scissors a_2 times and show paper a_3 times. Bob decided to show rock b_1 times, show scissors b_2 times and show paper b_3 times. Though, both Alice and Bob  the sequence in which they show things. It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n and b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n.Your task is to find two numbers:
822	Number of Subsequences You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters "", "" and "" and question marks "".Let the number of question marks in the string s be k. Let's replace each question mark with one of the letters "", "" and "". Here we can obtain all 3^{k} possible strings consisting only of letters "", "" and "". For example, if s = "" then we can obtain the following strings: ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""].Your task is to count the total number of subsequences "" in all resulting strings. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^{9} + 7.A subsequence of the string t is such a sequence that can be derived from the string t after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. For example, the string "" contains two subsequences "" — a subsequence consisting of letters at positions (2, 5, 6) and a subsequence consisting of letters at positions (3, 5, 6).
823	Avoiding Zero You are given an array of n integers a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n.You have to create an array of n integers b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n such that: For example, if a=[1,-1,0,1], then b=[-1,1,1,0] and b=[0,1,-1,1] are rearrangements of a, but b=[1,-1,-1,0] and b=[1,0,2,-3] are not rearrangements of a. If an array b_1,b_2,\dots, b_n with the required properties does not exist, you have to print .
824	Chess Cheater You like playing chess tournaments online.In your last tournament you played n games. For the sake of this problem, each chess game is either won or lost (no draws). When you lose a game you get 0 points. When you win you get 1 or 2 points: if you have won also the previous game you get 2 points, otherwise you get 1 point. If you win the very first game of the tournament you get 1 point (since there is not a "previous game").The outcomes of the n games are represented by a string s of length n: the i-th character of s is  if you have won the i-th game, while it is  if you have lost the i-th game.After the tournament, you notice a bug on the website that allows you to change the outcome of  k of your games (meaning that at most k times you can change some symbol  to , or  to ). Since your only goal is to improve your chess rating, you decide to cheat and use the bug.Compute the maximum score you can get by cheating in the optimal way.
825	The Hard Work of Paparazzi You are a paparazzi working in Manhattan.Manhattan has r south-to-north streets, denoted by numbers 1, 2,\ldots, r in order from west to east, and r west-to-east streets, denoted by numbers 1,2,\ldots,r in order from south to north. Each of the r south-to-north streets intersects each of the r west-to-east streets; the intersection between the x-th south-to-north street and the y-th west-to-east street is denoted by (x, y). In order to move from the intersection (x,y) to the intersection (x', y') you need |x-x'|+|y-y'| minutes.You know about the presence of n celebrities in the city and you want to take photos of as many of them as possible. More precisely, for each i=1,\dots, n, you know that the i-th celebrity will be at the intersection (x_i, y_i) in exactly t_i minutes from now (and he will stay there for a very short time, so you may take a photo of him only if at the t_i-th minute from now you are at the intersection (x_i, y_i)). You are very good at your job, so you are able to take photos instantaneously. You know that t_i < t_{i+1} for any i=1,2,\ldots, n-1.Currently you are at your office, which is located at the intersection (1, 1). If you plan your working day optimally, what is the maximum number of celebrities you can take a photo of?
826	Unshuffling a Deck You are given a deck of n cards numbered from 1 to n (not necessarily in this order in the deck). You have to sort the deck by repeating the following operation. You have to obtain a sorted deck (i.e., a deck where the first card is 1, the second is 2 and so on) performing at most n operations. It can be proven that it is always possible to sort the deck performing at most n operations. The following are three examples of valid operations (on three decks with different sizes). 
827	Xum You have a blackboard and initially only an  number x is written on it. Your goal is to write the number 1 on the blackboard.You may write new numbers on the blackboard with the following two operations. 
828	Boring Card Game When they are bored, Federico and Giada often play the following card game with a deck containing 6n cards.Each card contains one number between 1 and 6n and each number appears on exactly one card. Initially the deck is sorted, so the first card contains the number 1, the second card contains the number 2, \dots, and the last one contains the number 6n.Federico and Giada take turns, alternating; Federico starts.In his turn, the player takes 3 contiguous cards from the deck and puts them in his pocket. The order of the cards remaining in the deck is not changed. They play until the deck is empty (after exactly 2n turns). At the end of the game both Federico and Giada have 3n cards in their pockets.You are given the cards in Federico's pocket at the end of the game. Describe a sequence of moves that produces that set of cards in Federico's pocket.
829	Box is Pull Wabbit is trying to move a box containing food for the rest of the zoo in the coordinate plane from the point (x_1,y_1) to the point (x_2,y_2).He has a rope, which he can use to pull the box. He can only pull the box if he stands  1 unit away from the box in the direction of one of two coordinate axes. He will pull the box to where he is standing before moving out of the way in the same direction by 1 unit. For example, if the box is at the point (1,2) and Wabbit is standing at the point (2,2), he can pull the box right by 1 unit, with the box ending up at the point (2,2) and Wabbit ending at the point (3,2).Also, Wabbit can move 1 unit to the right, left, up, or down without pulling the box. In this case, it is not necessary for him to be in exactly 1 unit away from the box. If he wants to pull the box again, he must return to a point next to the box. Also, Wabbit can't move to the point where the box is located.Wabbit can start at any point. It takes 1 second to travel 1 unit right, left, up, or down, regardless of whether he pulls the box while moving.Determine the minimum amount of time he needs to move the box from (x_1,y_1) to (x_2,y_2). Note that the point where Wabbit ends up at does not matter.
830	Belted Rooms In the snake exhibition, there are n rooms (numbered 0 to n - 1) arranged in a circle, with a snake in each room. The rooms are connected by n conveyor belts, and the i-th conveyor belt connects the rooms i and (i+1) \bmod n. In the other words, rooms 0 and 1, 1 and 2, \ldots, n-2 and n-1, n-1 and 0 are connected with conveyor belts.The i-th conveyor belt is in one of three states:Above is an example with 4 rooms, where belts 0 and 3 are off, 1 is clockwise, and 2 is anticlockwise.Each snake wants to leave its room and come back to it later. A room is  if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such  rooms are there?
831	ABBB Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters '' and ''. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "" or "". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations:  \to  \to .Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?
832	Bouncing Boomerangs To improve the boomerang throwing skills of the animals, Zookeeper has set up an n \times n grid with some targets, . The rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.  For each column, Zookeeper will throw a boomerang from the bottom of the column (below the grid) upwards. When the boomerang hits any target, it will bounce off, make a 90 degree turn to the right and fly off in a straight line in its new direction. The boomerang can hit multiple targets and does not stop until it leaves the grid. In the above example, n=6 and the black crosses are the targets. The boomerang in column 1 (blue arrows) bounces 2 times while the boomerang in column 3 (red arrows) bounces 3 times. The boomerang in column i hits exactly a_i targets before flying out of the grid. However, Zookeeper has lost the original positions of the targets. Thus, he asks you to construct a valid configuration of targets that matches the number of hits for each column, or tell him that no such configuration exists. If multiple valid configurations exist, you may print any of them.
833	Carrots for Rabbits There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.
834	Fruit Sequences Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string s_1s_2\ldots s_n of length n. 1 represents an apple and 0 represents an orange.Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest  sequence of apples. Let f(l,r) be the longest  sequence of apples in the substring s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}. Help Zookeeper find \sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r), or the sum of f across all substrings.
835	Number of Apartments Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room — five windows, and a seven-room — seven windows.Monocarp went around the building and counted n windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has n windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.Here are some examples:
836	Barrels You have n barrels lined up in a row, numbered from left to right from one. Initially, the i-th barrel contains a_i liters of water.You can pour water from one barrel to another. In one act of pouring, you can choose two different barrels x and y (the x-th barrel shouldn't be empty) and pour any possible amount of water from barrel x to barrel y (possibly, all water). You may assume that barrels have infinite capacity, so you can pour any amount of water in each of them. Calculate the maximum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum amount of water in the barrels, if you can pour water  k times.Some examples: 
837	Numbers on Whiteboard Numbers 1, 2, 3, \dots n (each integer from 1 to n once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers a and b from the board and write one integer \frac{a + b}{2}  instead.You should perform the given operation n - 1 times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible. For example, if n = 4, the following course of action is optimal:It's easy to see that after n - 1 operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.
838	String Deletion You have a string s consisting of n characters. Each character is either  or .You can perform operations on the string. Each operation consists of two steps:Note that both steps are mandatory in each operation, and their order cannot be changed.For example, if you have a string s = , the first operation can be one of the following:You finish performing operations when the string s becomes empty. What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?
839	String Reversal You are given a string s. You have to reverse it — that is, the first letter should become equal to the last letter before the reversal, the second letter should become equal to the second-to-last letter before the reversal — and so on. For example, if your goal is to reverse the string "", you should get the string "". To accomplish your goal, you can swap the . Your task is to calculate the minimum number of swaps you have to perform to reverse the given string.
840	Realistic Gameplay Recently you've discovered a new shooter. They say it has realistic game mechanics.Your character has a gun with magazine size equal to k and should exterminate n waves of monsters. The i-th wave consists of a_i monsters and happens from the l_i-th moment of time up to the r_i-th moments of time. All a_i monsters spawn at moment l_i and you have to exterminate all of them before the moment r_i ends (you can kill monsters right at moment r_i). For every two consecutive waves, the second wave starts not earlier than the first wave ends (though the second wave can start at the same moment when the first wave ends) — formally, the condition r_i \le l_{i + 1} holds. Take a look at the notes for the examples to understand the process better.You are confident in yours and your character's skills so you can assume that aiming and shooting are instant and you need exactly one bullet to kill one monster. But reloading takes exactly 1 unit of time.One of the realistic mechanics is a mechanic of reloading: when you reload you throw away the old magazine with all remaining bullets in it. That's why constant reloads may cost you excessive amounts of spent bullets.You've taken a liking to this mechanic so now you are wondering: what is the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to exterminate all waves.Note that you don't throw the remaining bullets away after eradicating all monsters, and you start with a full magazine.
841	Boring Apartments There is a building consisting of 10~000 apartments numbered from 1 to 10~000, inclusive.Call an apartment , if its number consists of . Examples of boring apartments are 11, 2, 777, 9999 and so on.Our character is a troublemaker, and he calls the intercoms of all  apartments, till someone answers the call, in the following order:The resident of the boring apartment x answers the call, and our character  calling anyone further.Our character wants to know how many digits he pressed in total and your task is to help him to count the total number of keypresses.For example, if the resident of boring apartment 22 answered, then our character called apartments with numbers 1, 11, 111, 1111, 2, 22 and the total number of digits he pressed is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 13.You have to answer t independent test cases.
842	Yet Another Bookshelf There is a bookshelf which can fit n books. The i-th position of bookshelf is a_i = 1 if there is a book on this position and a_i = 0 otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is  on the bookshelf.In one move, you can choose some contiguous segment [l; r] consisting of books (i.e. for each i from l to r the condition a_i = 1 holds) and:Your task is to find the  number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a  (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).For example, for a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] there is a gap between books (a_4 = 0 when a_3 = 1 and a_5 = 1), for a = [1, 1, 0] there are no gaps between books and for a = [0, 0,0] there are also no gaps between books.You have to answer t independent test cases.
843	Dominant Piranha There are n piranhas with sizes a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n in the aquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the aquarium.Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is  piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called  if it can eat all the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other piranhas will do nothing while the  piranha will eat them.Because the aquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the adjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs (or as it can). More precisely: When the piranha i eats some piranha, its  (a_i becomes a_i + 1).Your task is to find  piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such piranhas.Note that you have to find  (exactly one) dominant piranha, you don't have to find all of them.For example, if a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5], then the third piranha can be . Consider the sequence of its moves: You have to answer t independent test cases.
844	Districts Connection There are n districts in the town, the i-th district belongs to the a_i-th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each other.You are the mayor of the city and want to build n-1 two-way roads to connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through other connected districts).If two districts belonging to the same gang are connected  with a road, this gang will revolt.You don't want this so your task is to build n-1 two-way roads in such a way that all districts are reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) and  of directly connected districts belong to , or determine that it is impossible to build n-1 roads to satisfy all the conditions.You have to answer t independent test cases.
845	Two Round Dances One day, n people (n is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly \frac{n}{2} people. Your task is to find the number of ways n people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly \frac{n}{2} people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.Round dance is a dance circle consisting of 1 or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances [1, 3, 4, 2], [4, 2, 1, 3] and [2, 1, 3, 4] are indistinguishable.For example, if n=2 then the number of ways is 1: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.For example, if n=4 then the number of ways is 3. Possible options:Your task is to find the number of ways n people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly \frac{n}{2} people.
846	Zero Remainder Sum  You are given a matrix a of size n \times m consisting of integers.You can choose  \left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor elements in . Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is  k and this sum is the .In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by k.Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 0).
847	A Convex Game Shikamaru and Asuma like to play different games, and sometimes they play the following: given an increasing list of numbers, they take turns to move. Each move consists of picking a number from the list.Assume the picked numbers are v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, \ldots, v_{i_k}. The following conditions must hold:However, it's easy to play only one instance of game, so today Shikamaru and Asuma decided to play n simultaneous games. They agreed on taking turns as for just one game, . At each turn, the player performs a valid move in any single game. The player who cannot move loses. Find out who wins, provided that both play optimally.
848	Reorder For a given array a consisting of n integers and a given integer m find if it is possible to reorder elements of the array a in such a way that \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\sum_{j=i}^{n}{\frac{a_j}{j}}} equals m? It is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. Please note that no rounding occurs during division, for example, \frac{5}{2}=2.5.
849	Prime Square Sasha likes investigating different math objects, for example, magic squares. But Sasha understands that magic squares have already been studied by hundreds of people, so he sees no sense of studying them further. Instead, he invented his own type of square — a prime square. A square of size n \times n is called prime if the following three conditions are held simultaneously: Sasha has an integer n. He asks you to find any prime square of size n \times n. Sasha is absolutely sure such squares exist, so just help him!
850	Binary Search Andrey thinks he is truly a successful developer, but in reality he didn't know about the binary search algorithm until recently. After reading some literature Andrey understood that this algorithm allows to quickly find a certain number x in an array. For an array a indexed from zero, and an integer x the pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:Note that the elements of the array are indexed from zero, and the division is done in integers (rounding down).Andrey read that the algorithm only works if the array is sorted. However, he found this statement untrue, because there certainly exist unsorted arrays for which the algorithm find x!Andrey wants to write a letter to the book authors, but before doing that he must consider the permutations of size n such that the algorithm finds x in them. A permutation of size n is an array consisting of n distinct integers between 1 and n in arbitrary order.Help Andrey and find the number of permutations of size n which contain x at position pos and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds x (returns true). As the result may be extremely large, print the remainder of its division by 10^9+7.
851	Bandit in a City Bandits appeared in the city! One of them is trying to catch as many citizens as he can.The city consists of n squares connected by n-1 roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any square from any other square. The square number 1 is the main square.After Sunday walk all the roads were changed to  roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any square from the main square.At the moment when the bandit appeared on the main square there were a_i citizens on the i-th square. Now the following process will begin. First, each citizen that is currently on a square with some outgoing one-way roads chooses one of such roads and moves along it to another square. Then the bandit chooses one of the one-way roads outgoing from the square he is located and moves along it. The process is repeated until the bandit is located on a square with no outgoing roads. The bandit catches all the citizens on that square.The bandit wants to catch as many citizens as possible; the citizens want to minimize the number of caught people. The bandit and the citizens know positions of all citizens at any time, the citizens can cooperate. If both sides act optimally, how many citizens will be caught?
852	Complicated Computations In this problem MEX of a certain array is the smallest  integer not contained in this array.Everyone knows this definition, including Lesha. But Lesha loves MEX, so he comes up with a new problem involving MEX every day, including today.You are given an array a of length n. Lesha considers all the  subarrays of the initial array and computes MEX for each of them. Then Lesha computes MEX of the obtained numbers.An array b is a subarray of an array a, if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possible none or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.Lesha understands that the problem is very interesting this time, but he doesn't know how to solve it. Help him and find the MEX of MEXes of all the subarrays!
853	Sum Over Subsets You are given a multiset S. Over all pairs of subsets A and B, such that:find the sum of \sum_{x \in A}{x} \cdot \sum_{x \in B}{x}, modulo 998\,244\,353.
854	Marketing Scheme You got a job as a marketer in a pet shop, and your current task is to boost sales of cat food. One of the strategies is to sell cans of food in packs with discounts. Suppose you decided to sell packs with a cans in a pack with a discount and some customer wants to buy x cans of cat food. Then he follows a greedy strategy: But customers are greedy in general, so if the customer wants to buy (x \bmod a) cans one by one and it happens that (x \bmod a) \ge \frac{a}{2} he decides to buy the whole pack of a cans (instead of buying (x \bmod a) cans). It makes you, as a marketer, happy since the customer bought more than he wanted initially.You know that each of the customers that come to your shop can buy any number of cans from l to r inclusive. Can you choose such size of pack a that each customer buys more cans than they wanted initially?
855	Reverse Binary Strings You are given a string s of even length n. String s is binary, in other words, consists only of 's and 's.String s has exactly \frac{n}{2} zeroes and \frac{n}{2} ones (n is even).In one operation you can reverse any substring of s. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string s ? A string is alternating if s_i \neq s_{i + 1} for all i. There are two types of alternating strings in general:  or 
856	Chef Monocarp Chef Monocarp has just put n dishes into an oven. He knows that the i-th dish has its optimal cooking time equal to t_i minutes.At any  minute T Monocarp can put  dish out of the oven. If the i-th dish is put out at some minute T, then its unpleasant value is |T - t_i| — the absolute difference between T and t_i. Once the dish is out of the oven, it can't go back in.Monocarp should put all the dishes out of the oven. What is the minimum total unpleasant value Monocarp can obtain?
857	Minimal Height Tree Monocarp had a tree which consisted of n vertices and was rooted at vertex 1. He decided to study BFS (), so he ran BFS on his tree, starting from the root. BFS can be described by the following pseudocode:Monocarp was fascinated by BFS so much that, in the end, he lost his tree. Fortunately, he still has a sequence of vertices, in which order vertices were visited by the BFS algorithm (the array  from the pseudocode). Monocarp knows that each vertex was visited exactly once (since they were put and taken from the queue exactly once). Also, he knows that all children of each vertex were viewed .Monocarp knows that there are many trees (in the general case) with the same visiting order a, so he doesn't hope to restore his tree. Monocarp is okay with any tree that . of a tree is the maximum depth of the tree's vertices, and the depth of a vertex is the number of edges in the path from the root to it. For example, the depth of vertex 1 is 0, since it's the root, and the depth of all root's children are 1.Help Monocarp to find any tree with given visiting order a and minimum height.
858	Make It Increasing You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and a set b of k distinct integers from 1 to n.In one operation, you may choose two integers i and x (1 \le i \le n, x can be any integer) and assign a_i := x. This operation can be done only if i does not belong to the set b.Calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform so the array a is increasing (that is, a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots < a_n), or report that it is impossible.
859	Emotional Fishermen n fishermen have just returned from a fishing vacation. The i-th fisherman has caught a fish of weight a_i.Fishermen are going to show off the fish they caught to each other. To do so, they firstly choose an order in which they show their fish (each fisherman shows his fish exactly once, so, formally, the order of showing fish is a permutation of integers from 1 to n). Then they show the fish they caught according to the chosen order. When a fisherman shows his fish, he might either become happy, become sad, or stay content.Suppose a fisherman shows a fish of weight x, and the maximum weight of a previously shown fish is y (y = 0 if that fisherman is the first to show his fish). Then:Let's call an order in which the fishermen show their fish  if, after all fishermen show their fish according to this order, each fisherman becomes either happy or sad. Calculate the number of  orders modulo 998244353.
860	Specific Tastes of Andre  Andre has very specific tastes. Recently he started falling in love with arrays.Andre calls an nonempty array b , if sum of its elements is divisible by the length of this array. For example, array [2, 3, 1] is good, as sum of its elements — 6 — is divisible by 3, but array [1, 1, 2, 3] isn't good, as 7 isn't divisible by 4. Andre calls an array a of length n  if the following conditions hold: Given a positive integer n, output any  array of length n. We can show that for the given constraints such an array always exists.An array c is a subarray of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
861	Valerii Against Everyone You're given an array b of length n. Let's define another array a, also of length n, for which a_i = 2^{b_i} (1 \leq i \leq n). Valerii says that every two non-intersecting subarrays of a have different sums of elements. You want to determine if he is wrong. More formally, you need to determine if there exist four integers l_1,r_1,l_2,r_2 that satisfy the following conditions: If such four integers exist, you will prove Valerii wrong. Do they exist?An array c is a subarray of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
862	Engineer Artem Artem is building a new robot. He has a matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns. The cell located on the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left has a value a_{i,j} written in it. If two adjacent cells contain the same value, the robot will break. A matrix is called  if no two adjacent cells contain the same value, where two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Artem wants to  to make a good.More formally, find a good matrix b that satisfies the following condition — For the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that such a matrix b always exists. If there are several such tables, you can output any of them. Please note that you do not have to minimize the number of increments.
863	Powerful Ksenia Ksenia has an array a consisting of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. In one operation she can do the following: She wants to make all a_i equal , or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!
864	Yurii Can Do Everything Yurii is sure he can do everything. Can he solve this task, though?He has an array a consisting of n positive integers. Let's call a subarray a[l...r]  if the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: In other words, a subarray is good if the bitwise XOR of the two border elements is equal to the sum of the rest of the elements. Yurii wants to calculate the total number of good subarrays. What is it equal to?An array c is a subarray of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
865	Olha and Igor Igor wants to find the key to Olha's heart. The problem is, that it's at the root of a binary tree.There is a perfect binary tree of height h consisting of n = 2^{h} - 1 nodes. The nodes have been assigned distinct labels from 1 to n. However, . To find key to Olha's heart he needs to find the label assigned to the root by making queries of the following type : Help Igor to find the root! the grader is not adaptive: the labels are fixed before any queries are made.
866	Graph Subset Problem You are given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Also, you are given an integer k.Find either a clique of size k or a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least k neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and subsets report about it.A subset of vertices is called a clique of size k if its size is k and there exists an edge between every two vertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if there exists an edge between them.
867	Greedy Shopping You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of integers. This array is .Let's consider a line with n shops. The shops are numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. The cost of a meal in the i-th shop is equal to a_i.You should process q queries of two types:
868	INOI Final Contests Today is the final contest of INOI (Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics). The contest room is a row with n computers. All computers are numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. There are m participants, numbered with integers from 1 to m.We have an array a of length m where a_{i} (1 \leq a_i \leq n) is the computer behind which the i-th participant wants to sit.Also, we have another array b of length m consisting of characters '' and ''. b_i is the side from which the i-th participant enters the room. '' means the participant enters from the left of computer 1 and goes from left to right, and '' means the participant enters from the right of computer n and goes from right to left.The participants in the order from 1 to m enter the room one by one. The i-th of them enters the contest room in the direction b_i and goes to sit behind the a_i-th computer. If it is occupied he keeps walking in his direction until he reaches the first unoccupied computer. After that, he sits behind it. If he doesn't find any computer he gets upset and gives up on the contest.The madness of the i-th participant is the distance between his assigned computer (a_i) and the computer he ends up sitting behind. The distance between computers i and j is equal to |i - j|.The values in the array a  equal. There exist n^m \cdot 2^m possible pairs of arrays (a, b).Consider all pairs of arrays (a, b) such that no person becomes upset. For each of them let's calculate the sum of participants madnesses. Find the sum of all these values.You will be given some prime modulo p. Find this sum by modulo p.
869	Cheat and Win Let's consider a (10^9+1) \times (10^9+1) field. The rows are numbered with integers from 0 to 10^9 and the columns are numbered with integers from 0 to 10^9. Let's define as (x, y) the cell located in the x-th row and y-th column.Let's call a cell (x, y) good if x \& y = 0, there \& is the  operation.Let's build a graph where vertices will be all good cells of the field and we will make an edge between all pairs of adjacent by side good cells. It can be proved that this graph will be a tree — connected graph without cycles. Let's hang this tree on vertex (0, 0), so we will have a rooted tree with root (0, 0).Two players will play the game. Initially, some good cells are black and others are white. Each player on his turn chooses a black good cell and a subset of its ancestors (possibly empty) and inverts their colors (from white to black and vice versa). The player who can't move (because all good cells are white) loses. It can be proved that the game is always finite.Initially, all cells are white. You are given m pairs of cells. For each pair color all cells in a simple path between them as black. Note that we do not invert their colors, we paint them black.Sohrab and Mashtali are going to play this game. Sohrab is the first player and Mashtali is the second.Mashtali wants to win and decided to cheat. He can make the following operation multiple times before the game starts: choose a cell and invert colors of all vertices on the path between it and the root of the tree.Mammad who was watching them wondered: "what is the minimum number of operations Mashtali should do to have a winning strategy?".Find the answer to this question for the initial painting of the tree. It can be proved that at least one possible way to cheat always exists.
870	Buy the String You are given four integers n, c_0, c_1 and h and a binary string s of length n.A binary string is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1.You can change any character of the string s (the string should be still binary after the change). You should pay h coins for each change.After some changes (possibly zero) you want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its characters. To buy the character 0 you should pay c_0 coins, to buy the character 1 you should pay c_1 coins.Find the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.
871	Sum of Medians A  of an array of integers of length n is the number standing on the \lceil {\frac{n}{2}} \rceil (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting with 1. For example, a median of the array [2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 5] is equal to 3. Given two integers n and k and  array of nk integers. Divide all numbers into k arrays of size n, such that each number belongs to  one array.You want the sum of medians of all k arrays to be the maximum possible. Find this maximum possible sum.
872	Extreme Subtraction You are given an array a of n positive integers.You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer 1 \le k \le n and do one of two things: For example, if n=5 and a=[3,2,2,1,4], then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below): Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.
873	Identify the Operations We start with a permutation a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and with an empty array b. We apply the following operation k times.On the i-th iteration, we select an index t_i (1 \le t_i \le n-i+1), remove a_{t_i} from the array, and append one of the numbers a_{t_i-1} or a_{t_i+1} (if t_i-1 or t_i+1 are within the array bounds) to the right end of the array b. Then we move elements a_{t_i+1}, \ldots, a_n to the left in order to fill in the empty space.You are given the initial permutation a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and the resulting array b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k. All elements of an array b are . Calculate the number of possible sequences of indices t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k modulo 998\,244\,353.
874	Graph Transpositions You are given a directed graph of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is a token in vertex 1.The following actions are allowed: The goal is to move the token from vertex 1 to vertex n in the shortest possible time. Print this time modulo 998\,244\,353.
875	Sum You are given n  arrays of non-negative numbers. Vasya repeats the following operation k times: Vasya wants to maximize the sum of the elements in his pocket.
876	Black, White and Grey Tree You are given a tree with each vertex coloured white, black or grey. You can remove elements from the tree by selecting a subset of vertices in a single connected component and removing them and their adjacent edges from the graph. The only restriction is that you are not allowed to select a subset containing a white and a black vertex at once.What is the minimum number of removals necessary to remove all vertices from the tree?
877	Differentiating Games Ginny is taking an exam on game theory. The professor is tired of hearing the same answers over and over again, so he offered Ginny to play a game instead of a standard exam. As known from the course, a combinatorial game on a graph with multiple starting positions is a game with a directed graph and multiple starting vertices holding a token each. Two players take turns moving one of the tokens along the graph edges on each turn. The player who can't make a move loses the game. If both players can play an infinitely long game without losing, a draw is called.For the exam, the professor drew an acyclic directed graph and chose one of its vertices. Ginny needs to guess the vertex the professor chose. To do so, Ginny can choose a multiset of vertices S several times and ask the professor: "If I put one token in each vertex of the given graph for each occurrence of the vertex in the multiset S, and then one more in the selected vertex, what would be the result of the combinatorial game?". Having given the task, the professor left the room to give Ginny some time to prepare for the game. Ginny thinks that she's being tricked because the problem is impossible to solve. Therefore, while the professor is away, she wants to add or remove several edges from the graph. Even though the original graph was acyclic, edges could be added to the graph to make cycles appear.
878	Kids Seating Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a \neq b) will indulge if: gcd(a, b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2, 3) = 1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.
879	Saving the City Bertown is a city with n buildings in a straight line.The city's security service discovered that some buildings were mined. A map was compiled, which is a string of length n, where the i-th character is "" if there is a mine under the building number i and "" otherwise.Bertown's best sapper knows how to activate mines so that the buildings above them are not damaged. When a mine under the building numbered x is activated, it explodes and activates two adjacent mines under the buildings numbered x-1 and x+1 (if there were no mines under the building, then nothing happens). Thus, it is enough to activate any one mine on a continuous segment of mines to activate all the mines of this segment. For manual activation of one mine, the sapper takes a coins. He can repeat this operation as many times as you want.Also, a sapper can place a mine under a building if it wasn't there. For such an operation, he takes b coins. He can also repeat this operation as many times as you want.The sapper can carry out operations in any order.You want to blow up all the mines in the city to make it safe. Find the minimum number of coins that the sapper will have to pay so that after his actions there are no mines left in the city.
880	The Delivery Dilemma Petya is preparing for his birthday. He decided that there would be n different dishes on the dinner table, numbered from 1 to n. Since Petya doesn't like to cook, he wants to order these dishes in restaurants.Unfortunately, all dishes are prepared in different restaurants and therefore Petya needs to pick up his orders from n different places. To speed up this process, he wants to order courier delivery at some restaurants. Thus, for each dish, there are two options for Petya how he can get it:Each restaurant has its own couriers and they start delivering the order at the moment Petya leaves the house. In other words, all couriers work in parallel. Petya must visit all restaurants in which he has not chosen delivery, he does this consistently.For example, if Petya wants to order n = 4 dishes and a = [3, 7, 4, 5], and b = [2, 1, 2, 4], then he can order delivery from the first and the fourth restaurant, and go to the second and third on your own. Then the courier of the first restaurant will bring the order in 3 minutes, the courier of the fourth restaurant will bring the order in 5 minutes, and Petya will pick up the remaining dishes in 1 + 2 = 3 minutes. Thus, in 5 minutes all the dishes will be at Petya's house.Find the minimum time after which all the dishes can be at Petya's home.
881	Long Permutation A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once. For example, [1], [4, 3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1] — are permutations, and [1, 1], [4, 3, 1], [2, 3, 4] — no.Permutation a is lexicographically smaller than permutation b (they have the same length n), if in the first index i in which they differ, a[i] < b[i]. For example, the permutation [1, 3, 2, 4] is lexicographically smaller than the permutation [1, 3, 4, 2], because the first two elements are equal, and the third element in the first permutation is smaller than in the second.The next permutation for a permutation a of length n — is the lexicographically smallest permutation b of length n that lexicographically larger than a. For example: You are given the number n — the length of the initial permutation. The initial permutation has the form a = [1, 2, \ldots, n]. In other words, a[i] = i (1 \le i \le n).You need to process q queries of two types: For each query of the 1-st type output the required sum.
882	Division Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division.To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with t pairs of integers p_i and q_i and for each pair decided to find the  integer x_i, such that: 
883	Divide and Sum You are given an array a of length 2n. Consider a partition of array a into two subsequences p and q of length n each (each element of array a should be in exactly one subsequence: either in p or in q).Let's sort p in non-decreasing order, and q in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by x and y, respectively. Then the  of a partition is defined as f(p, q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - y_i|.Find the sum of f(p, q) over all correct partitions of array a. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353.
884	Team-Building The new academic year has started, and Berland's university has n first-year students. They are divided into k academic groups, however, some of the groups might be empty. Among the students, there are m pairs of acquaintances, and each acquaintance pair might be both in a common group or be in two different groups.Alice is the curator of the first years, she wants to host an entertaining game to make everyone know each other. To do that, she will select two different academic groups and then divide the students of those groups into two teams. The game requires that there are no acquaintance pairs inside each of the teams.Alice wonders how many pairs of groups she can select, such that it'll be possible to play a game after that. All students of the two selected groups must take part in the game.Please note, that the teams Alice will form for the game don't need to coincide with groups the students learn in. Moreover, teams may have different sizes (or even be empty).
885	Rectangular Polyline One drew a closed polyline on a plane, that consisted only of vertical and horizontal segments (parallel to the coordinate axes). The segments alternated between horizontal and vertical ones (a horizontal segment was always followed by a vertical one, and vice versa). The polyline did not contain strict self-intersections, which means that in case any two segments shared a common point, that point was an endpoint for both of them (please consult the examples in the notes section).Unfortunately, the polyline was erased, and you only know the lengths of the horizonal and vertical segments. Please construct any polyline matching the description with such segments, or determine that it does not exist.
886	Finding the Vertex You are given a tree — connected undirected graph without cycles. One vertex of the tree is special, and you have to find which one. You can ask questions in the following form: given an edge of the tree, which endpoint is closer to the special vertex, meaning which endpoint's shortest path to the special vertex contains fewer edges. You have to find the special vertex by asking the minimum number of questions in the worst case for a given tree.Please note that the special vertex might not be fixed by the interactor in advance: it might change the vertex to any other one, with the requirement of being consistent with the previously given answers.
887	Array Rearrangment You are given two arrays a and b, each consisting of n positive integers, and an integer x. Please determine if one can rearrange the elements of b so that a_i + b_i \leq x holds for each i (1 \le i \le n).
888	Elimination There is a famous olympiad, which has more than a hundred participants. The Olympiad consists of two stages: the elimination stage, and the final stage. At least a hundred participants will advance to the final stage. The elimination stage in turn consists of two contests.A result of the elimination stage is the total score in two contests, but, unfortunately, the jury lost the final standings and has only standings for the first and for the second contest separately. In each contest, the participants are ranked by their point score in non-increasing order. When two participants have a tie (earned the same score), they are ranked by their passport number (in accordance with local regulations, all passport numbers are distinct). In the first contest, the participant on the 100-th place scored a points. Also, the jury checked all participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) in the first contest and found out that all of them have at least b points in the second contest.Similarly, for the second contest, the participant on the 100-th place has c points. And the jury checked that all the participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) have at least d points in the first contest.After two contests, all participants are ranked by their total score in two contests in non-increasing order. When participants have the same total score, tie-breaking with passport numbers is used. The  to qualify to the final stage is the total score of the participant on the 100-th place.Given integers a, b, c, d, please help the jury determine the smallest possible value of the cutoff score.
889	Knapsack You have a knapsack with the capacity of W. There are also n items, the i-th one has weight w_i. You want to put some of these items into the knapsack in such a way that their total weight C is at least half of its size, but (obviously) does not exceed it. Formally, C should satisfy: \lceil \frac{W}{2}\rceil \le C \le W. Output the list of items you will put into the knapsack or determine that fulfilling the conditions is impossible. If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you  have to maximize the sum of weights of items in the knapsack.
890	Catching Cheaters You are given two strings A and B representing essays of two students who are suspected cheaters. For any two strings C, D we define their similarity score S(C,D) as 4\cdot LCS(C,D) - |C| - |D|, where LCS(C,D) denotes the length of the Longest Common  of strings C and D. You believe that only some part of the essays could have been copied, therefore you're interested in their .Calculate the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings. More formally, output maximal S(C, D) over all pairs (C, D), where C is some substring of A, and D is some substring of B. If X is a string, |X| denotes its length.A string a is a  of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.A string a is a  of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters. Pay attention to the difference between the  and , as they both appear in the problem statement. You may wish to read the .
891	Xor Tree For a given sequence of  non-negative integers (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k) we determine if it is  in the following way:It is possible that for some numbers b_i and b_j, you will try to add the edge between them twice. Nevertheless, you will add this edge only once.You can find an example below (the picture corresponding to the first test case). Sequence (0, 1, 5, 2, 6)  good as we  reach 1 from 5.However, sequence (0, 1, 5, 2)  good. You are given a sequence (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) of  non-negative integers. You would like to remove some of the elements (possibly none) to make the  sequence good. What is the minimum possible number of removals required to achieve this goal?It can be shown that for any sequence, we can remove some number of elements, leaving at least 2, so that the remaining sequence is good.
892	Long Recovery A patient has been infected with an unknown disease. His body can be seen as an infinite grid of triangular cells which looks as follows:Two cells are neighboring if they share a side. Therefore, each cell (x, y) has exactly three neighbors: Initially some cells are infected, all the others are healthy. The process of recovery begins. Each second, for  cell (even though there might be multiple cells that could change its state) one of the following happens:If no such cell exists, the process of recovery stops. Patient is considered recovered if the process of recovery has stopped and all the cells are healthy.We're interested in a  scenario: is it possible that the patient never recovers, or if it's not possible, what is the maximum possible duration of the recovery process?
893	Line Distance You are given an integer k and n distinct points with integer coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the i-th point has coordinates (x_i, y_i).Consider a list of all the \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} pairs of points ((x_i, y_i), (x_j, y_j)) (1 \le i < j \le n). For every such pair, write out the distance from the line through these two points to the origin (0, 0).Your goal is to calculate the k-th smallest number among these distances.
894	Add Candies There are n bags with candies, initially the i-th bag contains i candies. You want all the bags to contain an equal amount of candies in the end. To achieve this, you will:Choose m such that 1 \le m \le 1000Perform m operations. In the j-th operation, you will pick one bag and add j candies to all bags apart from the chosen one.Your goal is to find a valid sequence of operations after which all the bags will contain an equal amount of candies. It can be proved that for the given constraints such a sequence always exists.You  have to minimize m.If there are several valid sequences, you can output .
895	Numbers Box You are given a rectangular grid with n rows and m columns. The cell located on the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left has a value a_{ij} written in it.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):Note that you can use a cell more than once in different operations.You are interested in X, the  of all the numbers in the grid. What is the maximum X you can achieve with these operations?
896	Avoid Trygub A string b is a subsequence of a string a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters. For example, "" is a subsequence of "" and "", but not "".You are given a string a. Your task is to reorder the characters of a so that "" is not a subsequence of the resulting string.In other words, you should find a string b which is a permutation of symbols of the string a and "" is not a subsequence of b.We have a truly marvelous proof that any string can be arranged not to contain "" as a subsequence, but this problem statement is too short to contain it.
897	Balls of Steel You have n  points (x_1, y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n) on the plane and a non-negative integer parameter k. Each point is a microscopic steel ball and k is the attract power of a ball when it's charged. The attract power is the same for all balls.In one operation, you can select a ball i to charge it. Once charged,  balls with Manhattan distance at most k from ball i move to the position of ball i. Many balls may have the same coordinate after an operation.More formally, for all balls j such that |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \le k, we assign x_j:=x_i and y_j:=y_i.Your task is to find the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or report that this is impossible.
898	Rating Compression On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers a of length n. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter k, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length k in a.More formally, for an array a of length n and an integer k, define the k-compression array of a as an array b of length n-k+1, such that b_j =\min_{j\le i\le j+k-1}a_iFor example, the 3-compression array of [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] is [\min\{1, 3, 4\}, \min\{3, 4, 5\}, \min\{4, 5, 2\}]=[1, 3, 2].A permutation of length m is an array consisting of m distinct integers from 1 to m in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3 but there is 4 in the array).A k-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array a, determine for all 1\leq k\leq n if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of this array or not.
899	Capitalism A society can be represented by a connected, undirected graph of n vertices and m edges. The vertices represent people, and an edge (i,j) represents a friendship between people i and j.In society, the i-th person has an income a_i. A person i is envious of person j if a_j=a_i+1. That is if person j has exactly 1 more unit of income than person i.The society is called  if for every pair of friends one is envious of the other. For some friendships, you know which friend is envious of the other. For the remaining friendships, you do not know the direction of envy.The  of society is defined as \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i - \min\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i.You only know the friendships and not the incomes. If it is impossible for this society to be capitalist with the given knowledge, you should report about it. Otherwise, you should find an assignment of incomes in which the society is capitalist, and the income inequality is maximized.
900	The Struggling Contestant To help those contestants who struggle a lot in contests, the headquarters of Codeforces are planning to introduce Division 5. In this new division, the tags of all problems will be announced prior to the round to help the contestants.The contest consists of n problems, where the tag of the i-th problem is denoted by an integer a_i.You want to AK (solve all problems). To do that, you must solve the problems in some order. To make the contest funnier, you created extra limitations on yourself. You do not want to solve two problems consecutively with the same tag since it is boring. Also, you are afraid of big jumps in difficulties while solving them, so you want to minimize the number of times that you solve two problems consecutively that are not adjacent in the contest order.Formally, your solve order can be described by a permutation p of length n. The  of a permutation is defined as the number of indices i (1\le i<n) where |p_{i+1}-p_i|>1. You have the requirement that a_{p_i}\ne a_{p_{i+1}} for all 1\le i< n.You want to know the minimum possible cost of permutation that satisfies the requirement. If no permutations meet this requirement, you should report about it.
901	Subtract or Divide Ridbit starts with an integer n.In one move, he can perform one of the following operations: A proper divisor is a divisor of a number, excluding itself. For example, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 are proper divisors of 20, but 20 itself is not.What is the minimum number of moves Ridbit is required to make to reduce n to 1?
902	Non-Substring Subsequence Hr0d1y has q queries on a binary string s of length n. A binary string is a string containing only characters '' and ''.A query is described by a pair of integers l_i, r_i (1 \leq l_i \lt r_i \leq n). For each query, he has to determine whether there exists a good subsequence in s that is equal to the substring s[l_i\ldots r_i]. Can you help Hr0d1y answer each query?
903	String Equality Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.In one move, he can either Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.
904	Circle Game Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves .Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at . In one move a player must increase either the x coordinate or the y coordinate of the token by  k. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance d from (0,0).In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are (p,q), then p^2 + q^2 \leq d^2 must hold.The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.
905	Nullify The Matrix Jeel and Ashish play a game on an n \times m matrix. The rows are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to m from left to right. They play turn by turn. Ashish goes .Initially, each cell of the matrix contains a non-negative integer. Each turn, a player must perform  of the following actions in order. If the starting and ending cells are the same, then as per the rules, the value of the cell is decreased. No other operations are performed.The game ends when all the values become zero. The player who is unable to make a move loses. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves if both players play optimally.Given the initial matrix, if both players play optimally, can you predict who will win?
906	Robot Program There is an infinite 2-dimensional grid. The robot stands in cell (0, 0) and wants to reach cell (x, y). Here is a list of possible commands the robot can execute:The robot wants to reach cell (x, y) in as few commands as possible. However, he can't execute the same command two or more times in a row.What is the minimum number of commands required to reach (x, y) from (0, 0)?
907	Toy Blocks You are asked to watch your nephew who likes to play with toy blocks in a strange way.He has n boxes and the i-th box has a_i blocks. His game consists of two steps: You don't want to make your nephew sad, so you decided to put several extra blocks into some boxes in such a way that no matter which box i he chooses he won't be sad. What is the minimum number of extra blocks you need to put?
908	Two Brackets You are given a string s, consisting of brackets of two types: '', '', '' and ''.A string is called a regular bracket sequence (RBS) if it's of one of the following types: where plus is a concatenation of two strings.In one move you can choose a non-empty subsequence of the string s (not necessarily consecutive) that is an RBS, remove it from the string and concatenate the remaining parts without changing the order.What is the maximum number of moves you can perform?
909	Radio Towers There are n + 2 towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from 0 to n + 1. The i-th town is located at the point i.You build a radio tower in each of the towns 1, 2, \dots, n with probability \frac{1}{2} (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from 1 to n (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town i with signal power p reaches every city c such that |c - i| < p.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:For example, if n = 5, and you have built the towers in towns 2, 4 and 5, you may set the signal power of the tower in town 2 to 2, and the signal power of the towers in towns 4 and 5 to 1. That way, towns 0 and n + 1 don't get the signal from any tower, towns 1, 2 and 3 get the signal from the tower in town 2, town 4 gets the signal from the tower in town 4, and town 5 gets the signal from the tower in town 5.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.
910	Two Editorials Berland regional ICPC contest has just ended. There were m participants numbered from 1 to m, who competed on a problemset of n problems numbered from 1 to n.Now the editorial is about to take place. There are two problem authors, each of them is going to tell the tutorial to  of the problemset. The authors choose the segment of k consecutive tasks for themselves independently of each other. The segments can coincide, intersect or not intersect at all.The i-th participant is interested in listening to the tutorial of all consecutive tasks from l_i to r_i. Each participant always chooses to listen to only the problem author that tells the tutorials to the maximum number of tasks he is interested in. Let this maximum number be a_i. No participant can listen to both of the authors, even if their segments don't intersect.The authors want to choose the segments of k consecutive tasks for themselves in such a way that the sum of a_i over all participants is maximized.
911	Divide Powers You are given a multiset of powers of two. More precisely, for each i from 0 to n exclusive you have cnt_i elements equal to 2^i.In one operation, you can choose any one element 2^l > 1 and divide it into two elements 2^{l - 1}.You should perform q queries. Each query has one of two types: Note that all queries of the second type don't change the multiset; that is, you just calculate the minimum number of operations, you don't perform them.
912	Cancel the Trains Gildong's town has a train system that has 100 trains that travel from the bottom end to the top end and 100 trains that travel from the left end to the right end. The trains starting from each side are numbered from 1 to 100, respectively, and all trains have the same speed. Let's take a look at the picture below.The train system can be represented as coordinates on a 2D plane. The i-th train starting at the bottom end is initially at (i,0) and will be at (i,T) after T minutes, and the i-th train starting at the left end is initially at (0,i) and will be at (T,i) after T minutes. All trains arrive at their destinations after 101 minutes.However, Gildong found that some trains scheduled to depart at a specific time, simultaneously, are very dangerous. At this time, n trains are scheduled to depart from the bottom end and m trains are scheduled to depart from the left end. If two trains are both at (x,y) at the same time for some x and y, they will crash into each other. Therefore, he is asking you to find the  number of trains that should be cancelled to prevent all such crashes.
913	Suffix Operations Gildong has an interesting machine that has an array a with n integers. The machine supports two kinds of operations:A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains a_n. In other words, for all i where a_i is included in the subsegment, all a_j's where i \lt j \le n must also be included in the subsegment.Gildong wants to make all elements of a equal — he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs. With your help, what is the minimum number of operations Gildong will perform?Note that even if you change one of the integers in the array, you should  count that as one of the operations because Gildong did not perform it.
914	Triangles Gildong has a square board consisting of n rows and n columns of square cells, each consisting of a single digit (from 0 to 9). The cell at the j-th column of the i-th row can be represented as (i, j), and the length of the side of each cell is 1. Gildong likes big things, so for each digit d, he wants to find a triangle such that:Of course, he can't just be happy with finding these triangles as is. Therefore, for each digit d, he's going to change the digit of exactly one cell of the board to d, then find such a triangle. He changes it back to its original digit after he is done with each digit. Find the maximum area of the triangle he can make for each digit.Note that he can put multiple vertices of the triangle on the same cell, and the triangle can be a ; i.e. the area of the triangle can be 0. Also, note that he is allowed to change the digit of a cell from d to d.
915	Checkpoints Gildong is developing a game consisting of n stages numbered from 1 to n. The player starts the game from the 1-st stage and should beat the stages in increasing order of the stage number. The player wins the game after beating the n-th stage.There is at most one checkpoint on each stage, and there is always a checkpoint on the 1-st stage. At the beginning of the game, only the checkpoint on the 1-st stage is activated, and all other checkpoints are deactivated. When the player gets to the i-th stage that has a checkpoint, that checkpoint is activated.For each try of a stage, the player can either beat the stage or fail the stage. If they beat the i-th stage, the player is moved to the i+1-st stage. If they fail the i-th stage, the player is moved to the most recent checkpoint they activated, and they have to beat the stages after that checkpoint again.For example, assume that n = 4 and the checkpoints are on the 1-st and 3-rd stages. The player starts at the 1-st stage. If they fail on the 1-st stage, they need to retry the 1-st stage because the checkpoint on the 1-st stage is the most recent checkpoint they activated. If the player beats the 1-st stage, they're moved to the 2-nd stage. If they fail it, they're sent back to the 1-st stage again. If they beat both the 1-st stage and the 2-nd stage, they get to the 3-rd stage and the checkpoint on the 3-rd stage is activated. Now whenever they fail on the 3-rd stage, or the 4-th stage after beating the 3-rd stage, they're sent back to the 3-rd stage. If they beat both the 3-rd stage and the 4-th stage, they win the game.Gildong is going to build the stages to have equal difficulty. He wants you to find any series of stages and checkpoints using at most 2000 stages, where the  of tries over all stages is exactly k, for a player whose probability of beating each stage is exactly \cfrac{1}{2}.
916	Dog Snacks Gildong is playing with his dog, Badugi. They're at a park that has n intersections and n-1 bidirectional roads, each 1 meter in length and connecting two intersections with each other. The intersections are numbered from 1 to n, and for every a and b (1 \le a, b \le n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection using some set of roads.Gildong has put one snack at every intersection of the park. Now Gildong will give Badugi a mission to eat all of the snacks. Badugi starts at the 1-st intersection, and he will move by the following rules:Unfortunately, Gildong doesn't know the value of k. So, he wants you to find the minimum value of k that makes it possible for Badugi to complete his mission, if Badugi moves optimally.
917	Even Harder Gildong is now developing a puzzle game. The puzzle consists of n platforms numbered from 1 to n. The player plays the game as a character that can stand on each platform and the goal of the game is to move the character from the 1-st platform to the n-th platform.The i-th platform is labeled with an integer a_i (0 \le a_i \le n-i). When the character is standing on the i-th platform, the player can move the character to any of the j-th platforms where i+1 \le j \le i+a_i. If the character is on the i-th platform where a_i=0 and i \ne n, the player loses the game.Since Gildong thinks the current game is not hard enough, he wants to make it even harder. He wants to change some (possibly zero) labels to 0 so that there remains exactly one way to win. He wants to modify the game as little as possible, so he's asking you to find the  number of platforms that should have their labels changed. Two ways are different if and only if there exists a platform the character gets to in one way but not in the other way.
918	Special Permutation You are given one integer n (n > 1).Recall that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation of length 5, but [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1, 3, 4] is also not a permutation (n = 3 but there is 4 in the array).Your task is to find a permutation p of length n that there is no index i (1 \le i \le n) such that p_i = i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition p_i \ne i should be satisfied).You have to answer t independent test cases.If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n > 1.
919	Unique Bid Auction There is a game called "Unique Bid Auction". You can read more about it here:  (though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are n participants, the i-th participant chose the number a_i. The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is  (i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and is  (i. e. among all unique values of a the minimum one is the winning one).Your task is to find the  of the participant who won the game (or  if there is no winner). Indexing is 1-based, i. e. the participants are numbered from 1 to n.You have to answer t independent test cases.
920	Sequence Transformation You are given a sequence a, initially consisting of n integers.You want to transform this sequence so that all elements in it  (i. e. it contains several occurrences of the same element).To achieve this, you choose some integer x , and then perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose some segment [l, r] of the sequence and remove it. But there is one exception: . More formally, you choose some contiguous subsequence [a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r] such that a_i \ne x if l \le i \le r, and remove it. After removal, the numbering of elements to the right of the removed segment changes: the element that was the (r+1)-th is now l-th, the element that was (r+2)-th is now (l+1)-th, and so on (i. e. the remaining sequence just collapses).Note that you  x after you chose it.For example, suppose n = 6, a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2]. Then one of the ways to transform it in two operations is to choose x = 1, then:Note that choosing x is not an operation. Also, note that you  remove any occurrence of x.Your task is to find the  number of operations required to transform the sequence in a way described above.You have to answer t independent test cases.
921	Number into Sequence You are given an integer n (n > 1).Your task is to find a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k such that:If there are several such sequences, any of them is acceptable. It can be proven that at least one valid sequence always exists for any integer n > 1.You have to answer t independent test cases.
922	Number of Simple Paths You are given an  graph consisting of n vertices and n edges. It is guaranteed that the given graph is  (i. e. it is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex) and there are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.Your task is to calculate the number of  of length  1 in the given graph. Note that paths that differ only by their direction are considered the same (i. e. you have to calculate the number of  paths). For example, paths [1, 2, 3] and [3, 2, 1] are considered the same.You have to answer t independent test cases.Recall that a path in the graph is a sequence of vertices v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k such that each pair of adjacent (consecutive) vertices in this sequence is connected by an edge. The length of the path is the number of edges in it. A  is such a path that all vertices in it are distinct.
923	Array Partition You are given an array a consisting of n integers.Let min(l, r) be the minimum value among a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r and max(l, r) be the maximum value among a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r.Your task is to choose three  (greater than 0) integers x, y and z such that:In other words, you have to split the array a into three consecutive non-empty parts that cover the whole array and the maximum in the first part equals the minimum in the second part and equals the maximum in the third part (or determine it is impossible to find such a partition).Among all such triples (partitions), you can choose any.You have to answer t independent test cases.
924	Strange Functions Let's define a function f(x) (x is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of x backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, f(321) = 123, f(120) = 21, f(1000000) = 1, f(111) = 111.Let's define another function g(x) = \dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} (x is a positive integer as well).Your task is the following: for the given positive integer n, calculate the number of different values of g(x) among all numbers x such that 1 \le x \le n.
925	Jumps You are standing on the \mathit{OX}-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0.You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and jump for the k-th time. You can: What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?
926	Ping-pong Alice and Bob play ping-pong with simplified rules.During the game, the player serving the ball commences a play. The server strikes the ball then the receiver makes a return by hitting the ball back. Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until one of them doesn't make a return.The one who doesn't make a return loses this play. The winner of the play commences the next play. Alice starts the first play.Alice has x stamina and Bob has y. To hit the ball (while serving or returning) each player spends 1 stamina, so if they don't have any stamina, they can't return the ball (and lose the play) or can't serve the ball (in this case, the other player serves the ball instead). If both players run out of stamina, the game is over.Sometimes, it's strategically optimal not to return the ball, lose the current play, but save the stamina. On the contrary, when the server commences a play, they have to hit the ball, if they have some stamina left.Both Alice and Bob play optimally and want to, firstly, maximize their number of wins and, secondly, minimize the number of wins of their opponent.Calculate the resulting number of Alice's and Bob's wins.
927	Sequence and Swaps You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, and an integer x. Your task is to make the sequence a sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le \dots \le a_n holds).To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer i such that 1 \le i \le n and a_i > x, and swap the values of a_i and x.For example, if a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4], x = 1, the following sequence of operations is possible:Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that a becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.
928	Four Points You are given four different integer points p_1, p_2, p_3 and p_4 on \mathit{XY} grid.In one step you can choose one of the points p_i and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point p_i = (x, y) you can move it to (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1), (x + 1, y) or (x - 1, y).Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to \mathit{OX} and \mathit{OY} axes (a square with side 0 is allowed).What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?
929	String and Operations You are given a string s consisting of n characters. These characters are among the first k lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. You have to perform n operations with the string.During the i-th operation, you take the character that  the i-th position, and perform  of the following actions with it:For example, suppose the initial string is , k = 20, and the sequence of operations is . Then the string is transformed as follows:The result of performing the sequence of operations is .Given the string s and the value of k, find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying a sequence of operations to s.
930	XOR-ranges Given integers c_{0}, c_{1}, \ldots, c_{k-1} we can define the cost of a number 0 \le x < 2^{k} as p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^{i}} \right\rfloor \bmod 2 \right) \cdot c_{i}. In other words, the cost of number x is the sum of c_{i} over the bits of x which are equal to one.Let's define the cost of array a of length n \ge 2 with elements from [0, 2^{k}) as follows: cost(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} p(a_{i} \oplus a_{i+1}), where \oplus denotes  operation.You have to construct an array of length n with minimal cost, given that each element should belong to the given segment: l_{i} \le a_{i} \le r_{i}.
931	Row GCD You are given two positive integer sequences a_1, \ldots, a_n and b_1, \ldots, b_m. For each j = 1, \ldots, m find the greatest common divisor of a_1 + b_j, \ldots, a_n + b_j.
932	Glass Half Spilled There are n glasses on the table numbered 1, \ldots, n. The glass i can hold up to a_i units of water, and currently contains b_i units of water.You would like to choose k glasses and collect as much water in them as possible. To that effect you can pour water from one glass to another as many times as you like. However, because of the glasses' awkward shape (and totally unrelated to your natural clumsiness), each time you try to transfer any amount of water, half of the amount is spilled on the floor.Formally, suppose a glass i currently contains c_i units of water, and a glass j contains c_j units of water. Suppose you try to transfer x units from glass i to glass j (naturally, x can not exceed c_i). Then, x / 2 units is spilled on the floor. After the transfer is done, the glass i will contain c_i - x units, and the glass j will contain \min(a_j, c_j + x / 2) units (excess water that doesn't fit in the glass is also spilled).Each time you transfer water, you can arbitrarlly choose from which glass i to which glass j to pour, and also the amount x transferred can be any positive real number.For each k = 1, \ldots, n, determine the largest possible total amount of water that can be collected in arbitrarily chosen k glasses after transferring water between glasses zero or more times.
933	Latin Square You are given a square matrix of size n. Every row and every column of this matrix is a permutation of 1, 2, \ldots, n. Let a_{i, j} be the element at the intersection of i-th row and j-th column for every 1 \leq i, j \leq n. Rows are numbered 1, \ldots, n top to bottom, and columns are numbered 1, \ldots, n left to right.There are six types of operations: One can see that after any sequence of operations every row and every column of the matrix will still be a permutation of 1, 2, \ldots, n.Given the initial matrix description, you should process m operations and output the final matrix.
934	Flip and Reverse You are given a string s of 's and 's. You are allowed to perform the following operation:For example, consider s = , and the following operation:Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s after zero or more operations.
935	Nim Shortcuts After your debut mobile game "Nim" blew up, you decided to make a sequel called "Nim 2". This game will expand on the trusted Nim game formula, adding the much awaited second heap! In the game, there are two heaps, each containing a non-negative number of stones. Two players make moves in turn. On their turn, a player can take any positive number of stones from either one of the heaps. A player who is unable to move loses the game.To make the game easier to playtest, you've introduced developer shortcuts. There are n shortcut positions (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n). These change the game as follows: suppose that before a player's turn the first and second heap contain x and y stones respectively. If the pair (x, y) is equal to one of the pairs (x_i, y_i), then the player about to move loses instantly, otherwise they are able to make moves as normal. Note that in the above explanation the two heaps and all pairs are , that is, x must refer to the size of the first heap, and y must refer to the size of the second heap.The game release was followed by too much celebration, and next thing you know is developer shortcuts made their way to the next official update of the game! Players now complain that the AI opponent has become unbeatable at certain stages of the game. You now have to write a program to figure out which of the given initial positions can be won by the starting player, assuming both players act optimally.
936	Range Diameter Sum You are given a tree with n vertices numbered 1, \ldots, n. A tree is a connected simple graph without cycles.Let \mathrm{dist}(u, v) be the number of edges in the unique simple path connecting vertices u and v.Let \mathrm{diam}(l, r) = \max \mathrm{dist}(u, v) over all pairs u, v such that l \leq u, v \leq r.Compute \sum_{1 \leq l \leq r \leq n} \mathrm{diam}(l, r).
937	Red-Blue Shuffle There are n cards numbered 1, \ldots, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, \ldots, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.
938	Move and Turn A robot is standing at the origin of the infinite two-dimensional plane. Each second the robot moves exactly 1 meter in one of the four cardinal directions: north, south, west, and east. For the first step the robot , but then at the end of every second it  90 degrees left or right with respect to the direction it just moved in. For example, if the robot has just moved north or south, the next step it takes has to be either west or east, and vice versa.The robot makes  n steps from its starting position according to the rules above. How many different points can the robot arrive to at the end? The final orientation of the robot can be ignored.
939	String Generation One fall day Joe got bored because he couldn't find himself something interesting to do. Marty suggested Joe to generate a string of length n to entertain him somehow. It didn't seem particularly difficult, but Joe's generated string had to follow these rules:A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. For example, strings "", "", "" are substrings of a string "", while strings "", "", "" are not.A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, strings "", "", "", "", "", and "" are palindromes, while strings "", "", and "" are not.Now Joe wants to find any correct string. Help him! It can be proven that the answer always exists under the given constraints.
940	Find the Spruce Holidays are coming up really soon. Rick realized that it's time to think about buying a traditional spruce tree. But Rick doesn't want real trees to get hurt so he decided to find some in an n \times m matrix consisting of "" and "".To find every spruce first let's define what a spruce in the matrix is. A set of matrix cells is called a spruce of height k with origin at point (x, y) if:Examples of correct and incorrect spruce trees:Now Rick wants to know how many spruces his n \times m matrix contains. Help Rick solve this problem.
941	Random Events Ron is a happy owner of a permutation a of length n.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).Ron's permutation is subjected to m experiments of the following type: (r_i, p_i). This means that elements in range [1, r_i] (in other words, the prefix of length r_i) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of p_i. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data.As an example, let's take a look at a permutation [4, 2, 1, 5, 3] and an experiment (3, 0.6). After such an experiment with the probability of 60\% the permutation will assume the form [1, 2, 4, 5, 3] and with a 40\% probability it will remain unchanged.You have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after m experiments.
942	Divide and Summarize Mike received an array a of length n as a birthday present and decided to test how pretty it is.An array would pass the i-th prettiness test if there is a way to get an array with a sum of elements totaling s_i, using some number (possibly zero) of slicing operations.An array slicing operation is conducted in the following way: You need to help Mike find out the results of q prettiness tests.Note that you test the prettiness of the array a, so you start each prettiness test with the primordial (initial) array a. Thus, the first slice (if required) is always performed on the array a.
943	Water Level In recent years John has very successfully settled at his new job at the office. But John doesn't like to idly sit around while his code is compiling, so he immediately found himself an interesting distraction. The point of his distraction was to maintain a water level in the water cooler used by other zebras.Originally the cooler contained exactly k liters of water. John decided that the amount of water must always be at least l liters of water but no more than r liters. John will stay at the office for exactly t days. He knows that each day exactly x liters of water will be used by his colleagues. At the beginning of each day he can add exactly y liters of water to the cooler, but at any point in time the amount of water in the cooler must be in the range [l, r].Now John wants to find out whether he will be able to maintain the water level at the necessary level for t days. Help him answer this question!
944	Mathematical Expression Barbara was late for her math class so as a punishment the teacher made her solve the task on a sheet of paper. Barbara looked at the sheet of paper and only saw n numbers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n without any mathematical symbols. The teacher explained to Barbara that she has to place the available symbols between the numbers in a way that would make the resulting expression's value as large as possible. To find out which symbols were available the teacher has given Barbara a string s which contained that information.It's easy to notice that Barbara has to place n - 1 symbols between numbers in total. The expression must start with a number and all symbols must be allowed (i.e. included in s). Note that multiplication takes precedence over addition or subtraction, addition and subtraction have the same priority and performed from left to right. Help Barbara and create the required expression!
945	Favorite Sequence Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1 \dots n] consisting of n integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:For example, if n=7 and a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2], then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1].You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.
946	Last Year's Substring Polycarp has a string s[1 \dots n] of length n consisting of decimal digits. Polycarp performs the following operation with the string s  (i.e. he can perform operation 0 or 1 time): For example, the string s = "" Polycarp can turn into strings: Polycarp likes the string "" very much, so he is wondering if it is possible to turn the string s into a string "" in no more than one operation? Note that you can perform zero operations.
947	Unique Number You are given a positive number x. Find the smallest positive integer number that has the sum of digits equal to x and all digits are  (unique).
948	Add to Neighbour and Remove Polycarp was given an array of a[1 \dots n] of n integers. He can perform the following operation with the array a no more than n times:The two items above together denote one single operation.For example, if Polycarp has an array a = [3, 1, 6, 6, 2], then it can perform the following sequence of operations with it: Note that Polycarp could stop performing operations at any time.Polycarp wondered how many minimum operations he would need to perform to make all the elements of a equal (i.e., he wants all a_i are equal to each other).
949	The Treasure of The Segments Polycarp found n segments on the street. A segment with the index i is described by two integers l_i and r_i — coordinates of the beginning and end of the segment, respectively. Polycarp realized that he didn't need all the segments, so he wanted to delete some of them.Polycarp believes that a set of k segments is good if there is a segment [l_i, r_i] (1 \leq i \leq k) from the set, such that it intersects every segment from the set (the intersection must be a ). For example, a set of 3 segments [[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 6]] is good, since the segment [2, 3] intersects each segment from the set. Set of 4 segments [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [4, 5]] is not good.Polycarp wonders, what is the minimum number of segments he has to delete so that the remaining segments form a good set?
950	Dungeon You are playing a new computer game in which you have to fight monsters. In a dungeon you are trying to clear, you met three monsters; the first of them has a health points, the second has b health points, and the third has c.To kill the monsters, you can use a cannon that, when fired, deals 1 damage to the selected monster. Every 7-th (i. e. shots with numbers 7, 14, 21 etc.) cannon shot is  and deals 1 damage to  monsters, not just one of them. If some monster's current amount of health points is 0, it can't be targeted by a regular shot and does not receive damage from an  shot.You want to pass the dungeon beautifully, i. e., kill all the monsters with the same  shot (i. e. after some  shot, the health points of each of the monsters should become equal to 0 ). Each shot must hit a monster, i. e. each shot deals damage to at least one monster.
951	Find The Array You are given an array [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] such that 1 \le a_i \le 10^9. Let S be the sum of all elements of the array a.Let's call an array b of n integers  if:Your task is to find any beautiful array. It can be shown that at least one beautiful array always exists.
952	Busy Robot You have a robot that can move along a number line. At time moment 0 it stands at point 0.You give n commands to the robot: at time t_i seconds you command the robot to go to point x_i. Whenever the robot receives a command, it starts moving towards the point x_i with the speed of 1 unit per second, and he stops when he reaches that point. However, while the robot is moving, it  all the other commands that you give him.For example, suppose you give three commands to the robot: at time 1 move to point 5, at time 3 move to point 0 and at time 6 move to point 4. Then the robot stands at 0 until time 1, then starts moving towards 5, ignores the second command, reaches 5 at time 6 and immediately starts moving to 4 to execute the third command. At time 7 it reaches 4 and stops there.You call the command i successful, if there is a time moment in the range [t_i, t_{i + 1}] (i. e. after you give this command and before you give another one, both bounds inclusive; we consider t_{n + 1} = +\infty) when the robot is at point x_i. Count the number of successful commands. Note that it is possible that an ignored command is successful.
953	Pairs You have 2n integers 1, 2, \dots, 2n. You have to redistribute these 2n elements into n pairs. After that, you choose x pairs and take minimum elements from them, and from the other n - x pairs, you take maximum elements.Your goal is to obtain the set of numbers \{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\} as the result of taking elements from the pairs.What is the number of different x-s (0 \le x \le n) such that it's possible to obtain the set b if for each x you can choose how to distribute numbers into pairs and from which x pairs choose minimum elements?
954	Plan of Lectures Ivan is a programming teacher. During the academic year, he plans to give n lectures on n different topics. Each topic should be used in exactly one lecture. Ivan wants to choose which topic will he explain during the 1-st, 2-nd, ..., n-th lecture — formally, he wants to choose some permutation of integers from 1 to n (let's call this permutation q). q_i is the index of the topic Ivan will explain during the i-th lecture.For each topic (except ), there exists a prerequisite topic (for the topic i, the prerequisite topic is p_i). Ivan cannot give a lecture on a topic before giving a lecture on its prerequisite topic. There exists at least one valid ordering of topics according to these prerequisite constraints.Ordering the topics correctly can help students understand the lectures better. Ivan has k special pairs of topics (x_i, y_i) such that he knows that the students will understand the y_i-th topic better if the lecture on it is conducted  the lecture on the x_i-th topic. Ivan wants to satisfy the constraints on every such pair, that is, for every i \in [1, k], there should exist some j \in [1, n - 1] such that q_j = x_i and q_{j + 1} = y_i.Now Ivan wants to know if there exists an ordering of topics that satisfies all these constraints, and if at least one exists, find any of them. 
955	Max Correct Set Let's call the set of positive integers S  if the following two conditions are met: For the given values n, x, and y, you have to find the maximum size of the  set.
956	No Game No Life Let's consider the following game of Alice and Bob on a directed acyclic graph. Each vertex may contain an arbitrary number of chips. Alice and Bob make turns alternating. Alice goes first. In one turn player can move exactly one chip along any edge outgoing from the vertex that contains this chip to the end of this edge. The one who cannot make a turn loses. Both players play optimally.Consider the following process that takes place every second on a given graph with n vertices: Find the probability that Alice will win the game. It can be shown that the answer can be represented as \frac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are coprime integers and Q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{998\,244\,353}. Print the value of P \cdot Q^{-1} \bmod 998\,244\,353.
957	My Beautiful Madness You are given a tree. We will consider simple paths on it. Let's denote path between vertices a and b as (a, b). Let d-neighborhood of a path be a set of vertices of the tree located at a distance \leq d from at least one vertex of the path (for example, 0-neighborhood of a path is a path itself). Let P be a multiset of the tree paths. Initially, it is empty. You are asked to maintain the following queries:
958	Bovine Dilemma Argus was charged with guarding Io, which is not an ordinary cow. Io is quite an explorer, and she wanders off rather frequently, making Argus' life stressful. So the cowherd decided to construct an enclosed pasture for Io.There are n trees growing along the river, where Argus tends Io. For this problem, the river can be viewed as the OX axis of the Cartesian coordinate system, and the n trees as points with the y-coordinate equal 0. There is also another tree growing in the point (0, 1). Argus will tie a rope around three of the trees, creating a triangular pasture. Its exact shape doesn't matter to Io, but its area is crucial to her. There may be many ways for Argus to arrange the fence, but only the ones which result in different areas of the pasture are interesting for Io. Calculate the number of  areas that her pasture may have. Note that the pasture must have  area.
959	Last minute enhancements Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will present it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is rather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. His song consists of n notes, which we will treat as . The  of a song is the number of  notes it contains. As a patron of music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the process of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing his song to make it more diverse.Being a minor goddess, she cannot arbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the n notes in the song, she can either leave it as it is or  it by 1.Given the song as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal, achievable diversity.
960	Canine poetry After his wife's tragic death, Eurydice, Orpheus descended to the realm of death to see her. Reaching its gates was uneasy, but passing through them proved to be even more challenging. Mostly because of Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades. Orpheus, a famous poet, and musician plans to calm Cerberus with his poetry and safely walk past him. He created a very peculiar poem for Cerberus. It consists only of lowercase English letters. We call a poem's substring a palindrome if and only if it reads the same backwards and forwards. A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deleting several (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.Unfortunately, Cerberus dislikes palindromes of length greater than 1. For example in the poem  the hound of Hades wouldn't like substrings  and .Orpheus can only calm Cerberus if the hound likes his poetry. That's why he wants to change his poem so that it does not contain any palindrome substrings of length .Orpheus can modify the poem by replacing a letter at any position with any lowercase English letter. He can use this operation arbitrarily many times (possibly zero). Since there can be many palindromes in his poem, he may have to make some corrections. But how many, exactly? Given the poem, determine the minimal number of letters that have to be changed so that the poem does not contain any palindromes of length greater than 1.
961	13th Labour of Heracles You've probably heard about the twelve labors of Heracles, but do you have any idea about the thirteenth? It is commonly assumed it took him a dozen years to complete the twelve feats, so on average, a year to accomplish every one of them. As time flows faster these days, you have minutes rather than months to solve this task. But will you manage?In this problem, you are given a tree with n weighted vertices. A tree is a connected graph with n - 1 edges.Let us define its k-coloring as an assignment of k colors to the edges so that each edge has exactly one color assigned to it. Note that you don't have to use all k colors.A subgraph of color x consists of these edges from the original tree, which are assigned color x, and only those vertices that are adjacent to at least one such edge. So there are no vertices of degree 0 in such a subgraph.The value of a connected component is the  of weights of its vertices. Let us define the value of a subgraph as a  of values of its connected components. We will assume that the value of an empty subgraph equals 0.There is also a value of a k-coloring, which equals the  of values of subgraphs of all k colors. Given a tree, for each k from 1 to n - 1 calculate the maximal value of a k-coloring.
962	Apollo versus Pan Only a few know that Pan and Apollo weren't only battling for the title of the GOAT musician. A few millenniums later, they also challenged each other in math (or rather in fast calculations). The task they got to solve is the following:Let x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n be the sequence of n non-negative integers. Find this value: \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n (x_i \, \& \, x_j) \cdot (x_j \, | \, x_k)Here \& denotes the  and | denotes the Pan and Apollo could solve this in a few seconds. Can you do it too? For convenience, find the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
963	Euclid's nightmare You may know that Euclid was a mathematician. Well, as it turns out, Morpheus knew it too. So when he wanted to play a mean trick on Euclid, he sent him an appropriate nightmare. In his bad dream Euclid has a set S of n m-dimensional vectors over the \mathbb{Z}_2 field and can perform vector addition on them. In other words he has vectors with m coordinates, each one equal either 0 or 1. Vector addition is defined as follows: let u+v = w, then w_i = (u_i + v_i) \bmod 2. Euclid can sum any subset of S and archive another m-dimensional vector over \mathbb{Z}_2. In particular, he can sum together an empty subset; in such a case, the resulting vector has all coordinates equal 0.Let T be the set of all the vectors that can be written as a sum of some vectors from S. Now Euclid wonders the size of T and whether he can use only a subset S' of S to obtain all the vectors from T. As it is usually the case in such scenarios, he will not wake up until he figures this out. So far, things are looking rather grim for the philosopher. But there is hope, as he noticed that all vectors in S have  2 coordinates equal 1. Help Euclid and calculate |T|, the number of m-dimensional vectors over \mathbb{Z}_2 that can be written as a sum of some vectors from S. As it can be quite large, calculate it modulo 10^9+7. You should also find S', the  such subset of S, that all vectors in T can be written as a sum of vectors from S'. In case there are multiple such sets with a minimal number of elements, output the lexicographically smallest one with respect to the order in which their elements are given in the input. Consider sets A and B such that |A| = |B|. Let a_1, a_2, \dots a_{|A|} and b_1, b_2, \dots b_{|B|} be increasing arrays of indices elements of A and B correspondingly. A is lexicographically smaller than B iff there exists such i that a_j = b_j for all j < i and a_i < b_i.
964	Wizard of Orz There are n digital panels placed in a straight line. Each panel can show any digit from 0 to 9. Initially, all panels show 0.Every second, the digit shown by each panel increases by 1. In other words, at the end of every second, a panel that showed 9 would now show 0, a panel that showed 0 would now show 1, a panel that showed 1 would now show 2, and so on.When a panel is paused, the digit displayed on the panel does not change in the subsequent seconds.You must pause exactly one of these panels, at any second you wish. Then, the panels adjacent to it get paused one second later, the panels adjacent to those get paused 2 seconds later, and so on. In other words, if you pause panel x, panel y (for all valid y) would be paused exactly |x−y| seconds later.For example, suppose there are 4 panels, and the 3-rd panel is paused when the digit 9 is on it.The resulting 4-digit number is 1090. .Once all panels have been paused, you write the digits displayed on them from left to right, to form an n digit number (it can consist of leading zeros). What is the largest possible number you can get? Initially, all panels show 0.
965	Hills And Valleys You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Let us call an index j (2 \le j \le {{n-1}}) a  if a_j > a_{{j+1}} and a_j > a_{{j-1}}; and let us call it a  if a_j < a_{{j+1}} and a_j < a_{{j-1}}.Let us define the  of a sequence as the sum of the number of hills and the number of valleys in the sequence. You can change  integer in the sequence to any number that you want, or let the sequence remain unchanged. What is the minimum  that you can achieve?
966	Three Bags You are given  bags. Each bag contains a non-empty multiset of numbers. You can perform a number of operations on these bags. In one operation, you can choose any two non-empty bags, and choose one number from each of the bags. Let's say that you choose number a from the first bag and number b from the second bag. Then, you remove b from the second bag and replace a with a-b in the first bag. Note that if there are multiple occurrences of these numbers, then you shall only remove/replace exactly one occurrence.You have to perform these operations in such a way that you have exactly one number remaining in exactly one of the bags (the other two bags being empty). It can be shown that you can always apply these operations to receive such a configuration in the end. Among all these configurations, find the one which has the maximum number left in the end.
967	Sum of Paths There are n cells, numbered 1,2,\dots, n from left to right. You have to place a robot at any cell initially. The robot must make  k moves.In one move, the robot must move one cell to the left or right, provided that it doesn't move out of bounds. In other words, if the robot was in the cell i, it must move to either the cell i-1 or the cell i+1, as long as it lies between 1 and n (endpoints inclusive). The cells, in the order they are visited (including the cell the robot is placed), together make a .Each cell i has a value a_i associated with it. Let c_0, c_1, \dots, c_k be the sequence of cells in a  in the order they are visited (c_0 is the cell robot is initially placed, c_1 is the cell where the robot is after its first move, and so on; more formally, c_i is the cell that the robot is at after i moves). Then the value of the path is calculated as a_{c_0} + a_{c_1} + \dots + a_{c_k}.Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all possible . Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Two  are considered different if the starting cell differs or there exists an integer i \in [1, k] such that the current cell of the robot after exactly i moves is different in those paths.You must process q updates to a and print the updated sum each time. Each update changes the value of exactly one cell. See the input format and the sample input-output for more details.
968	Distinctive Roots in a Tree You are given a tree with n vertices. Each vertex i has a value a_i associated with it.Let us root the tree at some vertex v. The vertex v is called a  if the following holds: in all paths that start at v and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.Find the number of  in the tree.
969	LaIS Let's call a sequence b_1, b_2, b_3 \dots, b_{k - 1}, b_k  if \min(b_1, b_2) \le \min(b_2, b_3) \le \dots \le \min(b_{k - 1}, b_k). In particular, any sequence with no more than two elements is almost increasing.You are given a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Calculate the length of its longest almost increasing subsequence.You'll be given t test cases. Solve each test case independently.Reminder: a  is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
970	Bakery Monocarp would like to open a bakery in his local area. But, at first, he should figure out whether he can compete with other shops.Monocarp plans that the bakery will work for n days. On the i-th day, a_i loaves of bread will be baked in the morning before the opening. At the end of the n-th day, Monocarp will sell all the remaining bread that wasn't sold earlier with a huge discount.Because of how bread is stored, the bakery seller sells the bread in the following order: firstly, he sells the loaves that were baked that morning; secondly, he sells the loaves that were baked the day before and weren't sold yet; then the loaves that were baked two days before and weren't sold yet, and so on. That's why some customers may buy a rather stale bread and will definitely spread negative rumors.Let's define loaf  as the difference between the day it was baked and the day it was sold. Then the  of the bakery will be equal to the maximum spoilage among all loaves of bread baked at the bakery.Suppose Monocarp's local area has  equal to k, it means that each day k customers will come to the bakery and each of them will ask for one loaf of bread (the loaves are sold according to the aforementioned order). If there is no bread left, then the person just doesn't buy anything. During the last day sale, all the remaining loaves will be sold (and they will still count in the calculation of the unattractiveness).Monocarp analyzed his competitors' data and came up with m possible consumer demand values k_1, k_2, \dots, k_m, and now he'd like to calculate the unattractiveness of the bakery for each value of demand. Can you help him?
971	Berpizza Monocarp and Polycarp are working as waiters in Berpizza, a pizzeria located near the center of Bertown. Since they are waiters, their job is to serve the customers, but they choose whom they serve first differently.At the start of the working day, there are no customers at the Berpizza. They come there one by one. When a customer comes into the pizzeria, she sits and waits for Monocarp or Polycarp to serve her. Monocarp has been working in Berpizza for just two weeks, so whenever he serves a customer, he simply chooses the one who came to Berpizza first, and serves that customer. On the other hand, Polycarp is an experienced waiter at Berpizza, and he knows which customers are going to spend a lot of money at the pizzeria (and which aren't) as soon as he sees them. For each customer, Polycarp estimates the amount of money this customer can spend, and when he serves a customer, he chooses the one that is expected to leave the most money at Berpizza (in case there are several such customers, he chooses the one who came first among them). Obviously, no customer can be served twice, so Monocarp and Polycarp choose which customer to serve only among those who haven't been served yet.When the number of customers gets really high, it becomes difficult for both Monocarp and Polycarp to choose the customer they are going to serve. Your task is to write a program that makes these choices for them. Formally, your program should be able to process three types of queries:For each query of types 2 and 3, report the number of the customer who was served (the customers are numbered in the order they come to the pizzeria, starting from 1).
972	Firecrackers Consider a long corridor which can be divided into n square cells of size 1 \times 1. These cells are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.There are two people in this corridor, a hooligan and a security guard. Initially, the hooligan is in the a-th cell, the guard is in the b-th cell (a \ne b). There are m firecrackers in the hooligan's pocket, the i-th firecracker explodes in s_i seconds after being lit.The following events happen each second (sequentially, ):Obviously, the hooligan will be caught sooner or later, since the corridor is finite. His goal is to see the maximum number of firecrackers explode before he is caught; that is, he will act in order to maximize the number of firecrackers that explodes before he is caught.Your task is to calculate the number of such firecrackers, if the hooligan acts optimally.
973	Four Segments Monocarp wants to draw four line segments on a sheet of paper. He wants the i-th segment to have its length equal to a_i (1 \le i \le 4). These segments can intersect with each other, and each segment should be either horizontal or vertical.Monocarp wants to draw the segments in such a way that they enclose a rectangular space, and the area of that rectangular space should be maximum possible.For example, if Monocarp wants to draw four segments with lengths 1, 2, 3 and 4, he can do it the following way:Calculate the maximum area of a rectangle Monocarp can enclose with four segments.
974	Full Turn There are n persons located on a plane. The i-th person is located at the point (x_i, y_i) and initially looks at the point (u_i, v_i).At the same moment of time, all persons will start to rotate clockwise synchronously with the same angular speed. They will rotate until they do one full 360-degree turn. It is said that persons A and B made eye contact if person A looks in person B's direction at the same moment when person B looks in person A's direction. If there is a person C located between persons A and B, that will not obstruct A and B from making eye contact. A person can make eye contact with more than one person at the same time.Calculate the number of pairs of persons that will make eye contact at least once during the rotation (including the initial moment).
975	Regular Bracket Sequence A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters  and  into this sequence. For example, sequences ,  and  are regular, while ,  and  are not. Let's call a regular bracket sequence "RBS".You are given a sequence s of n characters , , and/or .  in this sequence.You have to replace every character  with either  or  (different characters  can be replaced with different brackets). .Determine if it is possible to obtain an RBS after these replacements.
976	Red and Blue Monocarp had a sequence a consisting of n + m integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n + m}. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; n elements were painted red, all other m elements were painted blue.After painting the elements, he has written two sequences r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n and b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m. The sequence r consisted of all red elements of a ; similarly, the sequence b consisted of all blue elements of a .Unfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences r and b. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of f(a) = \max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \dots, (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_{n + m}))Help Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of f(a).
977	Building a Fence You want to build a fence that will consist of n equal sections. All sections have a width equal to 1 and height equal to k. You will place all sections in one line side by side.Unfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can think that the ground level under the i-th section is equal to h_i. You should follow several rules to build the fence: Is it possible to build a fence that meets all rules?
978	Ceil Divisions You have an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where a_i = i.In one step, you can choose two indices x and y (x \neq y) and set a_x = \left\lceil \frac{a_x}{a_y} \right\rceil (ceiling function).Your goal is to make array a consist of n - 1 ones and 1 two in no more than n + 5 steps. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of steps.
979	A Bit Similar Let's call two strings a and b (both of length k)  if they have the same character in some position, i. e. there exists at least one i \in [1, k] such that a_i = b_i.You are given a binary string s of length n (a string of n characters  and/or ) and an integer k. Let's denote the string s[i..j] as the substring of s starting from the i-th character and ending with the j-th character (that is, s[i..j] = s_i s_{i + 1} s_{i + 2} \dots s_{j - 1} s_j).Let's call a binary string t of length k  if it is  to all substrings of s having length exactly k; that is, it is  to s[1..k], s[2..k+1], \dots, s[n-k+1..n].Your goal is to find the  smallest string t that is , or report that no such string exists. String x is lexicographically less than string y if either x is a prefix of y (and x \ne y), or there exists such i (1 \le i \le \min(|x|, |y|)), that x_i < y_i, and for any j (1 \le j < i) x_j = y_j.
980	Power Sockets // Define a chain: You are given n chains of lengths l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n. You plan to build a tree using some of them.The distance between two vertices of the tree is the number of edges on the shortest path between them.If there is at least k white vertices in the resulting tree, then the value of the tree is the distance between the root and the k-th closest white vertex.What's the minimum value of the tree you can obtain? If there is no way to build a tree with at least k white vertices, then print .
981	Strange Birthday Party Petya organized a strange birthday party. He invited n friends and assigned an integer k_i to the i-th of them. Now Petya would like to give a present to each of them. In the nearby shop there are m unique presents available, the j-th present costs c_j dollars (1 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \ldots \le c_m). It's  allowed to buy a single present more than once.For the i-th friend Petya can either buy them a present j \le k_i, which costs c_j dollars, or just give them c_{k_i} dollars directly.Help Petya determine the minimum total cost of hosting his party.
982	Strange Definition Let us call two integers x and y  if \frac{lcm(x, y)}{gcd(x, y)} is a perfect square. For example, 3 and 12 are adjacent, but 6 and 9 are not.Here gcd(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y, and lcm(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y.You are given an array a of length n. Each second the following happens: each element a_i of the array is  by the product of all elements of the array (including itself), that are adjacent to the current value. Let d_i be the number of adjacent elements to a_i (including a_i itself). The  of the array is defined as \max_{1 \le i \le n} d_i. You are given q queries: each query is described by an integer w, and you have to output the beauty of the array after w seconds.
983	Strange Shuffle n people sitting in a circle are trying to shuffle a deck of cards. The players are numbered from 1 to n, so that players i and i+1 are neighbours (as well as players 1 and n). Each of them has exactly k cards, where k is . The left neighbour of a player i is player i - 1, and their right neighbour is player i + 1 (except for players 1 and n, who are respective neighbours of each other).Each turn the following happens: if a player has x cards, they give \lfloor x / 2 \rfloor to their neighbour on the left and \lceil x / 2 \rceil cards to their neighbour on the right. This happens for all players simultaneously.However, one player p is the impostor and they just give all their cards to their neighbour on the right. You know the number of players n and the number of cards k each player has initially, but p is unknown to you. Your task is to determine the value of p, by asking questions like "how many cards does player q have?" for an index q of your choice. After each question all players will make exactly one move and give their cards to their neighbours. You need to find the impostor by asking no more than 1000 questions.
984	Strange Housing Students of Winter Informatics School are going to live in a set of houses connected by underground passages. Teachers are also going to live in some of these houses, but they can not be accommodated randomly. For safety reasons, the following must hold:Please help the organizers to choose the houses where teachers will live to satisfy the safety requirements or determine that it is impossible.
985	Strange Permutation Alice had a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n. Unfortunately, the permutation looked very boring, so she decided to change it and choose some  subranges of this permutation and reverse them. The cost of reversing a single subrange [l, r] (elements from position l to position r, inclusive) is equal to r - l, and the cost of the operation is the sum of costs of reversing individual subranges. Alice had an integer c in mind, so she only considered operations that cost no more than c.Then she got  bored, and decided to write down all the permutations that she could possibly obtain by performing exactly one operation on the initial permutation. Of course, Alice is very smart, so she wrote down each obtainable permutation exactly once (no matter in how many ways it can be obtained), and of course the list was sorted lexicographically.Now Bob would like to ask Alice some questions about her list. Each question is in the following form: what is the i-th number in the j-th permutation that Alice wrote down? Since Alice is too bored to answer these questions, she asked you to help her out.
986	Strange Covering You are given n points on a plane. Please find the minimum sum of areas of two axis-aligned rectangles, such that each point is contained in at least one of these rectangles.Note that the chosen rectangles can be degenerate. Rectangle contains all the points that lie inside it or on its boundary.
987	Strange Partition You are given an array a of length n, and an integer x. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was [3, 6, 9], in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array [3, 15], or replace the first two elements to get an array [9, 9]. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation.The  of an array b=[b_1, \ldots, b_k] is defined as \sum_{i=1}^k \left\lceil \frac{b_i}{x} \right\rceil, which means that we divide each element by x, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if x = 3, and the array is [4, 11, 6], the beauty of the array is equal to \left\lceil \frac{4}{3} \right\rceil + \left\lceil \frac{11}{3} \right\rceil + \left\lceil \frac{6}{3} \right\rceil = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.
988	Strange List You have given an array a of length n and an integer x to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be q. If q is divisible by x, the robot adds x copies of the integer \frac{q}{x} to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if q is not divisible by x, the robot shuts down.Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.
989	Cards for Friends For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his n friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size w \times h, which can be cut into pieces.Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper w \times h that he has in only two cases: If w and h are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by 1.Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size w \times h at into n or more pieces, using only the rules described above.
990	Fair Division Alice and Bob received n candies from their parents. . Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.Check if they can do that.Note that candies .
991	Long Jumps Polycarp found under the Christmas tree an array a of n elements and instructions for playing with it: For example, if n = 5 and a = [7, 3, 1, 2, 3], then the following game options are possible: Help Polycarp to find out the maximum score he can get if he chooses the starting index in an optimal way.
992	Even-Odd Game During their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an array a of n integers: If there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The player with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal, then a draw is declared.For example, if n = 4 and a = [5, 2, 7, 3], then the game could go as follows (there are other options): You want to find out who will win if both players play optimally. .
993	Correct Placement Polycarp has invited n friends to celebrate the New Year. During the celebration, he decided to take a group photo of all his friends. Each friend can stand or lie on the side.Each friend is characterized by two values h_i (their height) and w_i (their width). On the photo the i-th friend will occupy a rectangle h_i \times w_i (if they are standing) or w_i \times h_i (if they are lying on the side).The j-th friend can be placed in front of the i-th friend on the photo if his rectangle is lower and narrower than the rectangle of the i-th friend. Formally,  of the following conditions must be fulfilled:For example, if n = 3, h=[3,5,3] and w=[4,4,3], then:In other cases, the person in the foreground will overlap the person in the background.Help Polycarp for each i find any j, such that the j-th friend can be located in front of the i-th friend (i.e. at least one of the conditions above is fulfilled).Please note that you do not need to find the arrangement of all people for a group photo. You just need to find for each friend i any other friend j who can be located in front of him. Think about it as you need to solve n separate independent subproblems.
994	New Year's Puzzle Polycarp got the following problem: given a grid strip of size 2 \times n, some cells of it are blocked. You need to check if it is possible to tile all free cells using the 2 \times 1 and 1 \times 2 tiles (dominoes).For example, if n = 5 and the strip looks like this (black cells are blocked):Then it can be tiled, for example, using two vertical and two horizontal tiles, as in the picture below (different tiles are marked by different colors).And if n = 3 and the strip looks like this:It is impossible to tile free cells.Polycarp easily solved this task and received his New Year's gift. Can you solve it?
995	Replacing Elements You have an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. All a_i are positive integers.In one step you can choose three distinct indices i, j, and k (i \neq j; i \neq k; j \neq k) and assign the sum of a_j and a_k to a_i, i. e. make a_i = a_j + a_k.Can you make all a_i lower or equal to d using the operation above any number of times (possibly, zero)?
996	String LCM Let's define a multiplication operation between a string a and a positive integer x: a \cdot x is the string that is a result of writing x copies of a one after another. For example, "" \cdot~2~= "", "" \cdot~5~= "".A string a is divisible by another string b if there exists an integer x such that b \cdot x = a. For example, "" is divisible by "", but is not divisible by "" or "".LCM of two strings s and t (defined as LCM(s, t)) is the shortest non-empty string that is divisible by both s and t.You are given two strings s and t. Find LCM(s, t) or report that it does not exist. It can be shown that if LCM(s, t) exists, it is unique.
997	No More Inversions You have a sequence a with n elements 1, 2, 3, \dots, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, \dots, k - (n - k) (k \le n < 2k).Let's call as inversion in a a pair of indices i < j such that a[i] > a[j].Suppose, you have some permutation p of size k and you build a sequence b of size n in the following manner: b[i] = p[a[i]].Your goal is to find such permutation p that the total number of inversions in b doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in a, and b is .Small reminder: the sequence of k integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to k exactly once.Another small reminder: a sequence s is  than another sequence t, if either s is a prefix of t, or for the first i such that s_i \ne t_i, s_i < t_i holds (in the first position that these sequences are different, s has smaller number than t).
998	Program You are given a program that consists of n instructions. Initially a single variable x is assigned to 0. Afterwards, the instructions are of two types: You are given m queries of the following format: 
999	Minimum Path You are given a weighted undirected connected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.Let's define the weight of the path consisting of k edges with indices e_1, e_2, \dots, e_k as \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{w_{e_i}} - \max\limits_{i=1}^{k}{w_{e_i}} + \min\limits_{i=1}^{k}{w_{e_i}}, where w_i — weight of the i-th edge in the graph.Your task is to find the minimum weight of the path from the 1-st vertex to the i-th vertex for each i (2 \le i \le n).
1000	Strange Set You are given an integer n and two sequences a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n and b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n.Let's call a set of integers S such that S \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\} , if, for every element i of S, the following condition is met: for every j \in [1, i - 1], if a_j divides a_i, then j is also included in S. An empty set is always .The  of the set S is \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i. You have to calculate the maximum possible  of a  set.
1001	Puzzle From the Future In the  year, Mike found two binary integers a and b of length n (both of them are written only by digits 0 and 1) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer d in the following way: Unfortunately, Mike lost integer a before he could calculate d himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find  integer a of length n such that d will be .Maximum possible as integer means that 102 > 21, 012 < 101, 021 = 21 and so on.
1002	Different Divisors Positive integer x is called  of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.We gave you an integer d and asked you to find  positive integer a, such that 
1003	Array Destruction You found a useless array a of 2n positive integers. You have realized that you actually don't need this array, so you decided to throw out all elements of a.It could have been an easy task, but it turned out that you should follow some rules: For example, if initially a = [3, 5, 1, 2], you can select x = 6. Then you can select the second and the third elements of a with sum 5 + 1 = 6 and throw them out. After this operation, x equals 5 and there are two elements in array: 3 and 2. You can throw them out on the next operation.Note, that you choose x before the start and can't change it as you want between the operations.Determine how should you behave to throw out all elements of a.
1004	Cleaning During cleaning the coast, Alice found n piles of stones. The i-th pile has a_i stones.Piles i and i + 1 are neighbouring for all 1 \leq i \leq n - 1. If pile i becomes empty, piles i - 1 and i + 1  become neighbouring.Alice is too lazy to remove these stones, so she asked you to take this duty. She allowed you to do only the following operation: Alice understands that sometimes it's impossible to remove all stones with the given operation, so she allowed you to use the following superability: Determine, if it is possible to remove all stones using the superability .
1005	What Is It? Lunar rover finally reached planet . After landing, he met an obstacle, that contains permutation p of length n. Scientists found out, that to overcome an obstacle, the robot should make p an identity permutation (make p_i = i for all i).Unfortunately, scientists can't control the robot. Thus the only way to make p an identity permutation is applying the following operation to p multiple times: Scientists asked you to find out the maximum possible time it will take the robot to finish making p an identity permutation (i. e. worst-case scenario), so they can decide whether they should construct a new lunar rover or just rest and wait. They won't believe you without proof, so you should build an example of p and robot's operations that maximizes the answer.For a better understanding of the statement, read the sample description.
1006	1 2 3 4 ... Igor had a sequence d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n of integers. When Igor entered the classroom there was an integer x written on the blackboard.Igor generated sequence p using the following algorithm: For example, if x = 3, and d = [1, -1, 2], p will be equal [3, 4, 3, 4, 5].Igor decided to calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence of p and the number of them.A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A sequence a is an increasing sequence if each element of a (except the first one) is strictly greater than the previous element.For p = [3, 4, 3, 4, 5], the length of longest increasing subsequence is 3 and there are 3 of them: [\underline{3}, \underline{4}, 3, 4, \underline{5}], [\underline{3}, 4, 3, \underline{4}, \underline{5}], [3, 4, \underline{3}, \underline{4}, \underline{5}].
1007	Odd Divisor You are given an integer n. Check if n has an  divisor, greater than one (does there exist such a number x (x > 1) that n is divisible by x and x is odd).For example, if n=6, then there is x=3. If n=4, then such a number does not exist.
1008	New Year's Number Polycarp remembered the 2020-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new 2021-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number n as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021.For example, if: Help Polycarp to find out whether the number n can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 2020 and a certain number of numbers 2021.
1009	Ball in Berland At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): But the following combinations are not possible: Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.
1010	Cleaning the Phone Polycarp often uses his smartphone. He has already installed n applications on it. Application with number i takes up a_i units of memory.Polycarp wants to free at least m units of memory (by removing some applications).Of course, some applications are more important to Polycarp than others. He came up with the following scoring system — he assigned an integer b_i to each application: According to this rating system, his phone has b_1 + b_2 + \ldots + b_n convenience points.Polycarp believes that if he removes applications with numbers i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k, then he will free a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \ldots + a_{i_k} units of memory and lose b_{i_1} + b_{i_2} + \ldots + b_{i_k} convenience points.For example, if n=5, m=7, a=[5, 3, 2, 1, 4], b=[2, 1, 1, 2, 1], then Polycarp can uninstall the following application sets (not all options are listed below): Help Polycarp, choose a set of applications, such that if removing them will free at least m units of memory and lose the minimum number of convenience points, or indicate that such a set does not exist.
1011	Advertising Agency Masha works in an advertising agency. In order to promote the new brand, she wants to conclude contracts with some bloggers. In total, Masha has connections of n different bloggers. Blogger numbered i has a_i followers.Since Masha has a limited budget, she can only sign a contract with k different bloggers. Of course, Masha wants her ad to be seen by as many people as possible. Therefore, she must hire bloggers with the maximum total number of followers.Help her, find the number of ways to select k bloggers so that the total number of their followers is maximum possible. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one blogger in the first way, which is not in the second way. Masha believes that all bloggers have different followers (that is, there is no follower who would follow two different bloggers).For example, if n=4, k=3, a=[1, 3, 1, 2], then Masha has two ways to select 3 bloggers with the maximum total number of followers: Since the answer can be quite large, .
1012	Unusual Matrix You are given two binary square matrices a and b of size n \times n. A matrix is called binary if each of its elements is equal to 0 or 1. You can do the following operations on the matrix a  number of times (0 or more): Note that the elements of the a matrix change after each operation.For example, if n=3 and the matrix a is:  \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  Then the following sequence of operations shows an example of transformations: Check if there is a sequence of operations such that the matrix a becomes equal to the matrix b.
1013	K-divisible Sum You are given two integers n and k.You should create an array of n  a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that the sum (a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n) is divisible by k and maximum element in a is minimum possible.What is the minimum possible maximum element in a?
1014	Inflation You have a statistic of price changes for one product represented as an array of n positive integers p_0, p_1, \dots, p_{n - 1}, where p_0 is the initial price of the product and p_i is how the price was increased during the i-th month.Using these price changes you are asked to calculate the inflation coefficients for each month as the ratio of current price increase p_i to the price at the start of this month (p_0 + p_1 + \dots + p_{i - 1}).Your boss said you clearly that the inflation coefficients must not exceed k %, so you decided to  some values p_i in such a way, that all p_i remain integers and the inflation coefficients for each month don't exceed k %.You know, that the bigger changes — the more obvious cheating. That's why you need to minimize the total sum of changes.What's the minimum total sum of changes you need to make all inflation coefficients not more than k %?
1015	Longest Simple Cycle You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 \le j < c_i.Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.A  is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.
1016	Journey There are n + 1 cities, numbered from 0 to n. n roads connect these cities, the i-th road connects cities i - 1 and i (i \in [1, n]).Each road has a direction. The directions are given by a string of n characters such that each character is either  or . If the i-th character is , it means that the i-th road initially goes from the city i to the city i - 1; otherwise it goes from the city i - 1 to the city i.A traveler would like to visit as many cities of this country as possible. Initially, they will choose some city to start their journey from. Each day, the traveler  go from the city where they currently are to a neighboring city using one of the roads, and they can go along a road only if it is directed in the same direction they are going; i. e., if a road is directed from city i to the city i + 1, it is possible to travel from i to i + 1, but not from i + 1 to i. After the traveler moves to a neighboring city,  roads change their directions . If the traveler cannot go from their current city to a neighboring city, their journey ends; it is also possible to end the journey whenever the traveler wants to.The goal of the traveler is to visit as many different cities as possible (they can visit a city multiple times, but only the first visit is counted). For each city i, calculate the maximum number of different cities the traveler can visit during  if they start in the city i. 
1017	Pattern Matching You are given n patterns p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n and m strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m. Each pattern p_i consists of k characters that are either lowercase Latin letters or wildcard characters (denoted by underscores). All patterns are pairwise distinct. Each string s_j consists of k lowercase Latin letters.A string a matches a pattern b if for each i from 1 to k either b_i is a wildcard character or b_i=a_i.You are asked to rearrange the patterns in such a way that the first pattern the j-th string matches is p[mt_j]. You are allowed to leave the order of the patterns unchanged.Can you perform such a rearrangement? If you can, then print any valid order.
1018	Lanterns There are n lanterns in a row. The lantern i is placed in position i and has power equal to p_i.Each lantern can be directed to illuminate either some lanterns to the left or some lanterns to the right. If the i-th lantern is turned to the left, it illuminates all such lanterns j that j \in [i - p_i, i - 1]. Similarly, if it is turned to the right, it illuminates all such lanterns j that j \in [i + 1, i + p_i].Your goal is to choose a direction for each lantern so each lantern is illuminated by at least one other lantern, or report that it is impossible.
1019	Nezzar and Board n  integers x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n are written on the board. Nezzar can perform the following operation multiple times.Now, Nezzar wonders if it is possible to have his favorite number k on the board after applying above operation multiple times.
1020	Nezzar and Binary String Nezzar has a binary string s of length n that he wants to share with his best friend, Nanako. Nanako will spend q days inspecting the binary string. At the same time, Nezzar wants to change the string s into string f during these q days, because it looks better.It is known that Nanako loves consistency so much. On the i-th day, Nanako will inspect a segment of string s from position l_i to position r_i inclusive. If the segment contains both characters '' and '', Nanako becomes unhappy and throws away the string.After this inspection, at the i-th night, Nezzar can secretly change  than half of the characters in the segment from l_i to r_i inclusive, otherwise the change will be too obvious.Now Nezzar wonders, if it is possible to avoid Nanako being unhappy and at the same time have the string become equal to the string f at the end of these q days and nights.
1021	Nezzar and Nice Beatmap Nezzar loves the game osu!.osu! is played on beatmaps, which can be seen as an array consisting of  points on a plane. A beatmap is called nice if for any three consecutive points A,B,C listed in order, the angle between these three points, centered at B, is  90 degrees.Now Nezzar has a beatmap of n  points A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n. Nezzar would like to reorder these n points so that the resulting beatmap is nice.Formally, you are required to find a permutation p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n of integers from 1 to n, such that beatmap A_{p_1},A_{p_2},\ldots,A_{p_n} is nice. If it is impossible, you should determine it.
1022	Nezzar and Hidden Permutations Nezzar designs a brand new game "Hidden Permutations" and shares it with his best friend, Nanako.At the beginning of the game, Nanako and Nezzar both know integers n and m. The game goes in the following way:However, Nezzar accidentally knows Nanako's unordered pairs and decides to take advantage of them. Please help Nezzar find out two permutations p and q such that the score is maximized.
1023	Nezzar and Tournaments In the famous Oh-Suit-United tournament, two teams are playing against each other for the grand prize of precious pepper points.The first team consists of n players, and the second team consists of m players. Each player has a potential: the potential of the i-th player in the first team is a_i, and the potential of the i-th player in the second team is b_i.In the tournament,  players will be on the stage in some order. There will be a scoring device, initially assigned to an integer k, which will be used to value the performance of all players.The scores for all players will be assigned in the order they appear on the stage. Let the potential of the current player be x, and the potential of the previous player be y (). Then, x-y is added to the value in the scoring device, Afterwards, if the value in the scoring device becomes negative, . Lastly, the player's score is assigned to the current value on the scoring device. The score of a team is the sum of the scores of all its members.As an insane fan of the first team, Nezzar desperately wants the biggest win for the first team. He now wonders what is the maximum difference between scores of the first team and the second team.Formally, let the score of the first team be score_f and the score of the second team be score_s. Nezzar wants to find the maximum value of score_f - score_s over all possible orders of players on the stage.However, situation often changes and there are q events that will happen. There are three types of events:Can you help Nezzar to answer the queries of the third type?
1024	Nezzar and Chocolate Bars Nezzar buys his favorite snack — n chocolate bars with lengths l_1,l_2,\ldots,l_n. However, chocolate bars might be too long to store them properly! In order to solve this problem, Nezzar designs an interesting process to divide them into small pieces. Firstly, Nezzar puts all his chocolate bars into a black box. Then, he will perform the following operation repeatedly until the maximum length over all chocolate bars does not exceed k.Nezzar now wonders, what is the expected number of operations he will perform to divide his chocolate bars into small pieces.It can be shown that the answer can be represented as \frac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are coprime integers and Q \not \equiv 0 (\bmod 998\,244\,353). Print the value of P\cdot Q^{-1} \mod 998\,244\,353.
1025	Nezzar and Colorful Balls Nezzar has n balls, numbered with integers 1, 2, \ldots, n. Numbers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n are written on them, respectively. Numbers on those balls form a non-decreasing sequence, which means that a_i \leq a_{i+1} for all 1 \leq i < n.Nezzar wants to color the balls using the minimum number of colors, such that the following holds.Note that a sequence with the length at most 1 is considered as a strictly increasing sequence.Please help Nezzar determine the minimum number of colors.
1026	Nezzar and Lucky Number Nezzar's favorite digit among 1,\ldots,9 is d. He calls a  integer lucky if d occurs at least once in its decimal representation. Given q integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_q, for each 1 \le i \le q Nezzar would like to know if a_i can be equal to a sum of several (one or more) lucky numbers.
1027	Nezzar and Symmetric Array Long time ago there was a symmetric array a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} consisting of 2n . Array a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} is called symmetric if for each integer 1 \le i \le 2n, there exists an integer 1 \le j \le 2n such that a_i = -a_j.For each integer 1 \le i \le 2n, Nezzar wrote down an integer d_i equal to the sum of absolute differences from a_i to all integers in a, i. e. d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{2n} {|a_i - a_j|}.Now a million years has passed and Nezzar can barely remember the array d and totally forget a. Nezzar wonders if there exists any symmetric array a consisting of 2n distinct integers that generates the array d.
1028	Searching Local Minimum .Homer likes arrays a lot and he wants to play a game with you. Homer has hidden from you a permutation a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n of integers 1 to n. You are asked to find any index k (1 \leq k \leq n) which is a local minimum. For an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, an index i (1 \leq i \leq n) is said to be a  if a_i < \min\{a_{i-1},a_{i+1}\}, where a_0 = a_{n+1} = +\infty. An array is said to be a permutation of integers 1 to n, if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.Initially, you are only given the value of n without any other information about this permutation.At each interactive step, you are allowed to choose any i (1 \leq i \leq n) and make a query with it. As a response, you will be given the value of a_i. You are asked to find any index k which is a local minimum .
1029	Continuous City Some time ago Homer lived in a beautiful city. There were n blocks numbered from 1 to n and m directed roads between them. Each road had a positive length, and each road went from the block with the smaller index to the block with the larger index. For every two (different) blocks, there was at most one road between them. Homer discovered that for some two numbers L and R the city was (L, R)-. The city is said to be (L, R)-continuous, if A path from block u to block v is a sequence u = x_0 \to x_1 \to x_2 \to \dots \to x_k = v, where there is a road from block x_{i-1} to block x_{i} for every 1 \leq i \leq k. The length of a path is the sum of lengths over all roads in the path. Two paths x_0 \to x_1 \to \dots \to x_k and y_0 \to y_1 \to \dots \to y_l are different, if k \neq l or x_i \neq y_i for some 0 \leq i \leq \min\{k, l\}. After moving to another city, Homer only remembers the two special numbers L and R but forgets the numbers n and m of blocks and roads, respectively, and how blocks are connected by roads. However, he believes the number of blocks should be no larger than 32 (because the city was small).As the best friend of Homer, please tell him whether it is possible to find a (L, R)-continuous city or not. 
1030	Odd Mineral Resource In Homer's country, there are n cities numbered 1 to n and they form a tree. That is, there are (n-1) undirected roads between these n cities and every two cities can reach each other through these roads. Homer's country is an industrial country, and each of the n cities in it contains some mineral resource. The mineral resource of city i is labeled a_i. Homer is given the plans of the country in the following q years. The plan of the i-th year is described by four parameters u_i, v_i, l_i and r_i, and he is asked to find any mineral resource c_i such that the following two conditions hold: As the best friend of Homer, he asks you for help. For every plan, find any such mineral resource c_i, or tell him that there doesn't exist one.
1031	School Clubs In Homer's school, there are n students who love clubs. Initially, there are m clubs, and each of the n students is in exactly one club. In other words, there are a_i students in the i-th club for 1 \leq i \leq m and a_1+a_2+\dots+a_m = n.The n students are so unfriendly that every day one of them (chosen  from all of the n students) gets angry. The student who gets angry will do one of the following things. Homer wonders the expected number of days until every student is in the same club for the first time.We can prove that the answer can be represented as a rational number \frac p q with \gcd(p, q) = 1. Therefore, you are asked to find the value of pq^{-1} \bmod 998\,244\,353. It can be shown that q \bmod 998\,244\,353 \neq 0 under the given constraints of the problem.
1032	Yet Another String Game Homer has two friends Alice and Bob. Both of them are string fans. One day, Alice and Bob decide to play a game on a string s = s_1 s_2 \dots s_n of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. They move in turns alternatively and .In a move, a player  choose an index i (1 \leq i \leq n) that has not been chosen before, and change s_i to any other lowercase English letter c that c \neq s_i.When all indices have been chosen, the game ends. The goal of Alice is to make the final string lexicographically as small as possible, while the goal of Bob is to make the final string lexicographically as large as possible. Both of them are game experts, so they always play games optimally. Homer is not a game expert, so he wonders what the final string will be.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: 
1033	The Great Hero The great hero guards the country where Homer lives. The hero has attack power A and initial health value B. There are n monsters in front of the hero. The i-th monster has attack power a_i and initial health value b_i. The hero or a monster is said to be living, if his or its health value is positive (greater than or equal to 1); and he or it is said to be dead, if his or its health value is non-positive (less than or equal to 0).In order to protect people in the country, the hero will fight with monsters until either the hero is dead or all the monsters are dead.For the safety of the people in the country, please tell them whether the great hero can kill all the monsters (even if the great hero himself is dead after killing the last monster).
1034	Space Navigation  You were dreaming that you are traveling to a planet named Planetforces on your personal spaceship. Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.Space can be represented as the XY plane. You are starting at point (0, 0), and Planetforces is located in point (p_x, p_y).The piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string s. The system reads s from left to right. Suppose you are at point (x, y) and current order is s_i: Since string s could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately, .Can you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from s in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?
1035	New Colony After reaching your destination, you want to build a new colony on the new planet. Since this planet has many mountains and the colony must be built on a flat surface you decided to flatten the mountains using boulders (you are still dreaming so this makes sense to you).You are given an array h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n, where h_i is the height of the i-th mountain, and k — the number of boulders you have.You will start throwing boulders from the top of the first mountain one by one and they will roll as follows (let's assume that the height of the current mountain is h_i): You want to find the position of the k-th boulder or determine that it will fall into the waste collection system.
1036	Fence Painting You finally woke up after this crazy dream and decided to walk around to clear your head. Outside you saw your house's fence — so plain and boring, that you'd like to repaint it.You have a fence consisting of n planks, where the i-th plank has the color a_i. You want to repaint the fence in such a way that the i-th plank has the color b_i.You've invited m painters for this purpose. The j-th painter will arrive at the moment j and will recolor  plank to color c_j. For each painter you can choose which plank to recolor, but you can't turn them down, i. e. each painter has to color exactly one plank.Can you get the coloring b you want? If it's possible, print for each painter which plank he must paint.
1037	AB Graph Your friend Salem is Warawreh's brother and only loves math and geometry problems. He has solved plenty of such problems, but according to Warawreh, in order to graduate from university he has to solve more graph problems. Since Salem is not good with graphs he asked your help with the following problem.You are given a complete directed graph with n vertices without self-loops. In other words, you have n vertices and each pair of vertices u and v (u \neq v) has both directed edges (u, v) and (v, u).Every directed edge of the graph is labeled with a single character: either '' or '' (edges (u, v) and (v, u) may have different labels).You are also given an integer m > 0. You should find a path of length m such that the string obtained by writing out edges' labels when going along the path is a . The length of the path is the number of edges in it..
1038	Sorting Books One day you wanted to read something, so you went to your bookshelf to grab some book. But when you saw how messy the bookshelf was you decided to clean it up first.There are n books standing in a row on the shelf, the i-th book has color a_i.You'd like to rearrange the books to make the shelf look beautiful. The shelf is considered  if all books of the same color are next to each other.In one operation you can take one book from any position on the shelf and move it to the right end of the shelf.What is the minimum number of operations you need to make the shelf beautiful?
1039	AB Tree Kilani and Abd are neighbors for 3000 years, but then the day came and Kilani decided to move to another house. As a farewell gift, Kilani is going to challenge Abd with a problem written by their other neighbor with the same name Abd.The problem is:You are given a connected tree rooted at node 1.You should assign a character  or  to every node in the tree so that the total number of 's is equal to x and the total number of 's is equal to n - x.Let's define a string for each node v of the tree as follows: You should assign every node a character in a way that  among the strings of all nodes.
1040	Prison Break Michael is accused of violating the social distancing rules and creating a risk of spreading coronavirus. He is now sent to prison. Luckily, Michael knows exactly what the prison looks like from the inside, especially since it's very simple.The prison can be represented as a rectangle a\times b which is divided into ab cells, each representing a prison cell, common sides being the walls between cells, and sides on the perimeter being the walls leading to freedom. Before sentencing, Michael can ask his friends among the prison employees to make (very well hidden) holes in some of the walls (including walls between cells and the outermost walls). Michael wants to be able to get out of the prison after this, no matter which cell he is placed in. However, he also wants to break as few walls as possible.Your task is to find out the smallest number of walls to be broken so that there is a path to the outside from every cell after this.
1041	Restore Modulo For the first place at the competition, Alex won many arrays of integers and was assured that these arrays are very expensive. After the award ceremony Alex decided to sell them. There is a rule in arrays pawnshop: you can sell array only if it can be compressed to a generator.This generator takes four non-negative numbers n, m, c, s. n and m must be positive, s non-negative and for c it must be true that 0 \leq c < m. The array a of length n is created according to the following rules: For example, if n = 5, m = 7, c = 4, and s = 10, then a = [3, 0, 4, 1, 5].Price of such an array is the value of m in this generator.Alex has a question: how much money he can get for each of the arrays. Please, help him to understand for every array whether there exist four numbers n, m, c, s that generate this array. If yes, then maximize m.
1042	Basic Diplomacy Aleksey has n friends. He is also on a vacation right now, so he has m days to play this new viral cooperative game! But since it's cooperative, Aleksey will need one teammate in each of these m days.On each of these days some friends will be available for playing, and all others will not. On each day Aleksey must choose one of his available friends to offer him playing the game (and they, of course, always agree). However, if any of them happens to be chosen strictly more than \left\lceil\dfrac{m}{2}\right\rceil times, then all other friends are offended. Of course, Aleksey doesn't want to offend anyone.Help him to choose teammates so that nobody is chosen strictly more than \left\lceil\dfrac{m}{2}\right\rceil times.
1043	Playlist Arkady has a playlist that initially consists of n songs, numerated from 1 to n in the order they appear in the playlist. Arkady starts listening to the songs in the playlist one by one, starting from song 1. The playlist is cycled, i. e. after listening to the last song, Arkady will continue listening from the beginning.Each song has a genre a_i, which is a positive integer. Let Arkady finish listening to a song with genre y, and the genre of the next-to-last listened song be x. If \operatorname{gcd}(x, y) = 1, he deletes the last listened song (with genre y) from the playlist. After that he continues listening normally, skipping the deleted songs, and  about songs he listened to before. In other words, after he deletes a song, he can't delete the next song immediately.Here \operatorname{gcd}(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y.For example, if the initial songs' genres were [5, 9, 2, 10, 15], then the playlist is converted as follows: [, 9, 2, 10, 15] \to [, , 2, 10, 15] \to [5, 2, 10, 15] (because \operatorname{gcd}(5, 9) = 1) \to [5, , 10, 15] \to [5, , , 15] \to [5, 2, , ] \to [, 2, 10, ] \to [, , 10, 15] \to [5, 10, 15] (because \operatorname{gcd}(5, 2) = 1) \to [5, , 15] \to [5, , ] \to ... The bold numbers represent the two last played songs. Note that after a song is deleted, Arkady forgets that he listened to that and the previous songs.Given the initial playlist, please determine which songs are eventually deleted and the order these songs are deleted.
1044	Skyline Photo Alice is visiting New York City. To make the trip fun, Alice will take photos of the city skyline and give the set of photos as a present to Bob. However, she wants to find the set of photos with maximum beauty and she needs your help. There are n buildings in the city, the i-th of them has positive height h_i. All n building heights in the city are different. In addition, each building has a beauty value b_i. Note that beauty can be positive or negative, as there are ugly buildings in the city too. A set of photos consists of one or more photos of the buildings in the skyline. Each photo includes one or more buildings in the skyline that form a contiguous segment of indices. Each building needs to be in  photo. This means that if a building does not appear in any photo, or if a building appears in more than one photo, the set of pictures is not valid. The beauty of a photo is equivalent to the beauty b_i of the shortest building in it. The total beauty of a set of photos is the sum of the beauty of all photos in it. Help Alice to find the maximum beauty a valid set of photos can have. 
1045	Useful Edges You are given a weighted undirected graph on n vertices along with q triples (u, v, l), where in each triple u and v are vertices and l is a positive integer. An edge e is called  if there is at least one triple (u, v, l) and a path (not necessarily simple) with the following properties:Please print the number of useful edges in this graph.
1046	Vabank Gustaw is the chief bank manager in a huge bank. He has unlimited access to the database system of the bank, in a few clicks he can move any amount of money from the bank's reserves to his own private account. However, the bank uses some fancy AI fraud detection system that makes stealing more difficult.Gustaw knows that the anti-fraud system just detects any operation that exceeds some fixed limit M euros and these operations are checked manually by a number of clerks. Thus, any fraud operation exceeding this limit is detected, while any smaller operation gets unnoticed.Gustaw doesn't know the limit M and wants to find it out. In one operation, he can choose some integer X and try to move X euros from the bank's reserves to his own account. Then, the following happens. Initially Gustaw has 1 euro on his account. Help him find the exact value of M in no more than 105 operations without getting him fired.
1047	Exam This year a Chunin Selection Exam is held again in Konoha, and taking part in it are n ninjas named s_1, s_2, ..., s_n. All names are distinct. One of the exam stages consists of fights between the participants. This year the rules determining the ninjas for each fight are the following: ninjas i and j fight against each other if the following conditions are held:A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.Your task is to find out how many fights are going to take place this year.
1048	Add and Divide You have two positive integers a and b.You can perform two kinds of operations:Find the minimum number of operations required to make a=0.
1049	Replace and Keep Sorted Given a positive integer k, two arrays are called k-similar if:You are given an integer k, a  array a and q queries. For each query, you are given two integers l_i \leq r_i. Your task is to find how many arrays b exist, such that b is k-similar to array [a_{l_i},a_{l_i+1}\ldots,a_{r_i}]. 
1050	Floor and Mod A pair of positive integers (a,b) is called  if \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor = a \bmod b. Here, \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor is the result of the integer division between a and b, while a \bmod b is its remainder.You are given two integers x and y. Find the number of special pairs (a,b) such that 1\leq a \leq x and 1 \leq b \leq y.
1051	Multiples and Power Differences You are given a matrix a consisting of positive integers. It has n rows and m columns.Construct a matrix b consisting of positive integers. It should have the same size as a, and the following conditions should be met: We can show that the answer always exists.
1052	Move and Swap You are given n - 1 integers a_2, \dots, a_n and a tree with n vertices rooted at vertex 1. The leaves are all at the same distance d from the root. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. The distance between two vertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them. All non-root vertices with degree 1 are leaves. If vertices s and f are connected by an edge and the distance of f from the root is greater than the distance of s from the root, then f is called a child of s.Initially, there are a red coin and a blue coin on the vertex 1. Let r be the vertex where the red coin is and let b be the vertex where the blue coin is. You should make d moves. A move consists of three steps: Note that r and b can be equal at any time, and there is no number written on the root.After each move, you gain |a_r - a_b| points. What's the maximum number of points you can gain after d moves?
1053	Copy or Prefix Sum You are given an array of integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n.An array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of integers is  if for each i (1 \leq i \leq n) at least one of these conditions is true: Find the number of hybrid arrays a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
1054	Shifting Stacks You have n stacks of blocks. The i-th stack contains h_i blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the i-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the i + 1-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing?Note that the number of stacks always remains n: stacks don't disappear when they have 0 blocks.
1055	Eastern Exhibition You and your friends live in n houses. Each house is located on a 2D plane, in a point with integer coordinates. There might be different houses located in the same point. The mayor of the city is asking you for places for the building of the Eastern exhibition. You have to find the number of places (points with integer coordinates), so that the summary distance from all the houses to the exhibition is minimal. The exhibition can be built in the same point as some house. The distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|, where |x| is the absolute value of x. 
1056	Max Median You are a given an array a of length n. Find a subarray a[l..r] with length at least k with the largest median.A median in an array of length n is an element which occupies position number \lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: median([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2, median([3, 2, 1]) = 2, median([2, 1, 2, 1]) = 1.Subarray a[l..r] is a contiguous part of the array a, i. e. the array a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r for some 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n, its length is r - l + 1.
1057	Paired Payment There are n cities and m bidirectional roads in the country. The roads in the country form an undirected weighted graph. The graph . Each road has it's own parameter w. You can travel through the roads, but the government made a new law: you can only go through two roads at a time (go from city a to city b and then from city b to city c) and you will have to pay (w_{ab} + w_{bc})^2 money to go through those roads. Find out whether it is possible to travel from city 1 to every other city t and what's the minimum amount of money you need to get from 1 to t.
1058	Pairs of Paths You are given a tree consisting of n vertices, and m simple vertex paths. Your task is to find how many pairs of those paths intersect at exactly one vertex. More formally you have to find the number of pairs (i, j) (1 \leq i < j \leq m) such that path_i and path_j have exactly one vertex in common. 
1059	Arena n heroes fight against each other in the Arena. Initially, the i-th hero has level a_i.Each minute, a fight between two different heroes occurs. These heroes can be chosen arbitrarily ().When two heroes of equal levels fight, nobody wins the fight. When two heroes of different levels fight, the one with the higher level wins, and his level increases by 1.The winner of the tournament is the first hero that wins in at least 100^{500} fights . A  is a hero such that there exists a sequence of fights that this hero becomes the winner of the tournament.Calculate the number of  among n heroes.
1060	Cat Cycle Suppose you are living with two cats: A and B. There are n napping spots where both cats usually sleep.Your cats like to sleep and also like all these spots, so they change napping spot each hour cyclically: The cat B is much younger, so they have a strict hierarchy: A and B don't lie together. In other words, if both cats'd like to go in spot x then the A takes this place and B moves to the next place in its order (if x < n then to x + 1, but if x = n then to 1). Cat B follows his order, so .Calculate, where cat B will be at hour k?
1061	Minimum Ties A big football championship will occur soon! n teams will compete in it, and each pair of teams will play exactly one game against each other.There are two possible outcomes of a game:The score of a team is the number of points it gained during all games that it played.You are interested in a hypothetical situation when all teams get the same score at the end of the championship. A simple example of that situation is when all games result in ties, but you want to minimize the number of ties as well.Your task is to describe a situation (choose the result of each game) so that all teams get the same score, and the number of ties is the minimum possible.
1062	Pythagorean Triples A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers (a, b, c) such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to a, b and c, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is (3, 4, 5).Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: c = a^2 - b.Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple (3, 4, 5): 5 = 3^2 - 4, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers (a, b, c) with 1 \le a \le b \le c \le n such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.
1063	Cheap Dinner Ivan wants to have a good dinner. A good dinner should consist of a first course, a second course, a drink, and a dessert.There are n_1 different types of first courses Ivan can buy (the i-th of them costs a_i coins), n_2 different types of second courses (the i-th of them costs b_i coins), n_3 different types of drinks (the i-th of them costs c_i coins) and n_4 different types of desserts (the i-th of them costs d_i coins).Some dishes don't go well with each other. There are m_1 pairs of first courses and second courses that don't go well with each other, m_2 pairs of second courses and drinks, and m_3 pairs of drinks and desserts that don't go well with each other.Ivan wants to buy exactly one first course, one second course, one drink, and one dessert so that they go well with each other, and the total cost of the dinner is the minimum possible. Help him to find the cheapest dinner option!
1064	Ones You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer n.You have to represent n as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits ''). For example, 24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1 and 102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1. Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.
1065	Dense Array Polycarp calls an array dense if the greater of any two adjacent elements is not more than twice bigger than the smaller. More formally, for any i (1 \le i \le n-1), this condition must be satisfied: \frac{\max(a[i], a[i+1])}{\min(a[i], a[i+1])} \le 2For example, the arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 3], [1, 1, 1] and [5, 10] are dense. And the arrays [5, 11], [1, 4, 2], [6, 6, 1] are  dense.You are given an array a of n integers. What is the minimum number of numbers you need to add to an array to make it dense? You can insert numbers anywhere in the array. If the array is already dense, no numbers need to be added.For example, if a=[4,2,10,1], then the answer is 5, and the array itself after inserting elements into it may look like this: a=[4,2,\underline{\textbf{3}},\underline{\textbf{5}},10,\underline{\textbf{6}},\underline{\textbf{4}},\underline{\textbf{2}},1] (there are other ways to build such a).
1066	Balanced Remainders You are given a number n () and an array a[1 \dots n]. In one move, you can increase any of the array elements by one. Formally, you choose the index i (1 \le i \le n) and  a_i with a_i + 1. You can choose the same index i multiple times for different moves.Let's denote by c_0, c_1 and c_2 the number of numbers from the array a that have remainders 0, 1 and 2 when divided by the number 3, respectively. Let's say that the array a has balanced remainders if c_0, c_1 and c_2 are equal.For example, if n = 6 and a = [0, 2, 5, 5, 4, 8], then the following sequence of moves is possible: Find the minimum number of moves needed to make the array a have balanced remainders.
1067	Sum of Cubes You are given a positive integer x. Check whether the number x is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.Formally, you need to check if there are two integers a and b (1 \le a, b) such that a^3+b^3=x.For example, if x = 35, then the numbers a=2 and b=3 are suitable (2^3+3^3=8+27=35). If x=4, then no pair of numbers a and b is suitable.
1068	Permutation Transformation A permutation — is a sequence of length n integers from 1 to n, in which all the numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1], [3, 5, 2, 1, 4], [1, 3, 2] — permutations, and [2, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1], [0] — no.Polycarp was recently gifted a permutation a[1 \dots n] of length n. Polycarp likes trees more than permutations, so he wants to transform permutation a into a rooted binary tree. He transforms an array of different integers into a tree as follows: For example, if he builds a tree by permutation a=[3, 5, 2, 1, 4], then the root will be the element a_2=5, and the left subtree will be the tree that will be built for the subarray a[1 \dots 1] = [3], and the right one — for the subarray a[3 \dots 5] = [2, 1, 4]. As a result, the following tree will be built: Another example: let the permutation be a=[1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4]. In this case, the tree looks like this: Let us denote by d_v the depth of the vertex a_v, that is, the number of edges on the path from the root to the vertex numbered a_v. Note that the root depth is zero. Given the permutation a, for each vertex, find the value of d_v.
1069	Accidental Victory A championship is held in Berland, in which n players participate. The player with the number i has a_i (a_i \ge 1) tokens.The championship consists of n-1 games, which are played according to the following rules:The last player with non-zero tokens is the winner of the championship.All random decisions that are made during the championship are made equally probable and independently.For example, if n=4, a = [1, 2, 4, 3], then one of the options for the game (there could be other options) is: Championship winners will receive personalized prizes. Therefore, the judges want to know in advance which players have a chance of winning, i.e have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. You have been asked to find all such players. 
1070	Equalize the Array Polycarp was gifted an array a of length n. Polycarp considers an array beautiful if there exists a number C, such that each number in the array occurs either zero or C times. Polycarp wants to remove some elements from the array a to make it beautiful.For example, if n=6 and a = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2], then the following options are possible to make the array a array beautiful: Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array a to make it beautiful.
1071	K-th Largest Value You are given an array a consisting of n integers. . You need to process q queries of two kinds:As a reminder, k-th largest value of the array b is defined as following:For example, the second largest element in array [0, 1, 0, 1] is 1, as after sorting in non-increasing order it becomes [1, 1, 0, 0], and the second element in this array is equal to 1.
1072	Minimal Cost There is a graph of n rows and 10^6 + 2 columns, where rows are numbered from 1 to n and columns from 0 to 10^6 + 1:Let's denote the node in the row i and column j by (i, j).Initially for each i the i-th row has exactly one obstacle — at node (i, a_i). You want to move some obstacles so that you can reach node (n, 10^6+1) from node (1, 0) by moving through edges of this graph (you can't pass through obstacles). Moving one obstacle to an adjacent by edge free node costs u or v coins, as below:Refer to the picture above for a better understanding. Now you need to calculate the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node (n, 10^6+1) from node (1, 0) by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.
1073	Pekora and Trampoline There is a trampoline park with n trampolines in a line. The i-th of which has strength S_i.Pekora can jump on trampolines in multiple passes. She starts the pass by jumping on any trampoline of her choice. If at the moment Pekora jumps on trampoline i, the trampoline will launch her to position i + S_i, and S_i will become equal to \max(S_i-1,1). In other words, S_i will decrease by 1, except of the case S_i=1, when S_i will remain equal to 1. If there is no trampoline in position i + S_i, then this pass is over. Otherwise, Pekora will continue the pass by jumping from the trampoline at position i + S_i by the same rule as above.. Poor Pekora!Pekora is a naughty rabbit and wants to ruin the trampoline park by reducing all S_i to 1. What is the minimum number of passes she needs to reduce all S_i to 1?
1074	Zookeeper and The Infinite Zoo There is a new attraction in Singapore Zoo: The Infinite Zoo.The Infinite Zoo can be represented by a graph with an infinite number of vertices labeled 1,2,3,\ldots. There is a directed edge from vertex u to vertex u+v if and only if u\&v=v, where \& denotes the . There are no other edges in the graph.Zookeeper has q queries. In the i-th query she will ask you if she can travel from vertex u_i to vertex v_i by going through directed edges.
1075	Fib-tree Let F_k denote the k-th term of Fibonacci sequence, defined as below:You are given a tree with n vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.We call a tree a , if its number of vertices equals F_k for some k, and at least one of the following conditions holds:Determine whether the given tree is a Fib-tree or not.
1076	Magnets Kochiya Sanae is playing with magnets. Realizing that some of those magnets are demagnetized, she is curious to find them out.There are n magnets, which can be of the following 3 types:Note that  the types of these magnets beforehand.You have a machine which can measure the force between the magnets, and you can use it  n+\lfloor \log_2n\rfloor times.You can put some magnets to the left part of the machine and some to the right part of the machine, and launch the machine. Obviously, you can put one magnet to at most one side (you don't have to put all magnets). You can put the same magnet in different queries.Then the machine will tell the force these magnets produce. Formally, let n_1,s_1 be the number of  and  magnets correspondently on the left and n_2,s_2 — on the right. Then the force between them would be n_1n_2+s_1s_2-n_1s_2-n_2s_1. Please note that the force is a  value.However, when the  value of the force is  n, the machine will crash into pieces.You need to find  magnets of type  (all demagnetized ones), .. The types of the magnets are fixed before the start of the interaction and do not change with queries.It is guaranteed that there are  2 magnets whose type is not , and  1 magnet of type .
1077	Three swimmers Three swimmers decided to organize a party in the swimming pool! At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool.It takes the first swimmer exactly a minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly b minutes for the second swimmer and c minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after 0, a, 2a, 3a, ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at 0, b, 2b, 3b, ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after 0, c, 2c, 3c, ... minutes.You came to the left side of the pool exactly p minutes after they started swimming. Determine how long you have to wait before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.
1078	Card Deck You have a deck of n cards, and you'd like to reorder it to a new one.Each card has a value between 1 and n equal to p_i. All p_i are pairwise distinct. Cards in a deck are numbered from bottom to top, i. e. p_1 stands for the bottom card, p_n is the top card. In each step you pick some integer k > 0, take the top k cards from the original deck and place them, in the order they are now, on top of the new deck. You perform this operation until the original deck is empty. (Refer to the notes section for the better understanding.)Let's define an  as \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}{n^{n - i} \cdot p_i}.Given the original deck, output the deck with maximum possible order you can make using the operation above.
1079	Maximum width Your classmate, whom you do not like because he is boring, but whom you respect for his intellect, has two strings: s of length n and t of length m.A sequence p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m, where 1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_m \leq n, is called , if s_{p_i} = t_i for all i from 1 to m. The  of a sequence is defined as \max\limits_{1 \le i < m} \left(p_{i + 1} - p_i\right).Please help your classmate to identify the beautiful sequence with the . Your classmate promised you that for the given strings s and t there is at least one beautiful sequence.
1080	Genius's Gambit You are given three integers a, b, k.Find two  integers x and y (x \ge y) such that 
1081	Almost Fault-Tolerant Database You are storing an integer array of length m in a database. To maintain internal integrity and protect data, the database stores n copies of this array.Unfortunately, the recent incident may have altered the stored information in every copy in the database.It's believed, that the incident altered at most two elements in every copy. You need to recover the original array based on the current state of the database.In case there are multiple ways to restore the array, report any. If there is no array that differs from every copy in no more than two positions, report that as well.
1082	Anti-knapsack You are given two integers n and k. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to n so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to k.A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.
1083	Planet Lapituletti The time on the planet Lapituletti goes the same way it goes on Earth but a day lasts h hours and each hour lasts m minutes. The inhabitants of that planet use digital clocks similar to earth ones. Clocks display time in a format  (the number of hours in decimal is displayed first, then (after the colon) follows the number of minutes in decimal; the number of minutes and hours is written with leading zeros if needed to form a two-digit number). Hours are numbered from 0 to h-1 and minutes are numbered from 0 to m-1. That's how the digits are displayed on the clock. Please note that digit 1 is placed in the  of its position. A standard mirror is in use on the planet Lapituletti. Inhabitants often look at the reflection of the digital clocks in the mirror and feel happy when what you see on the reflected clocks is a valid time (that means that you see valid digits in the reflection and this time can be seen on the normal clocks at some moment of a day).The image of the clocks in the mirror is reflected against a vertical axis. The reflection is not a valid time.The reflection is a valid time with h=24, m = 60. However, for example, if h=10, m=60, then the reflection is not a valid time. An inhabitant of the planet Lapituletti begins to look at a mirrored image of the clocks at some time moment s and wants to know the nearest future time moment (which can possibly happen on the next day), when the reflected clock time is valid.It can be shown that with any h, m, s such a moment exists. If the reflected time is correct at the moment the inhabitant began to look at the clock, that moment is considered the nearest.You are asked to solve the problem for several test cases.
1084	K-beautiful Strings You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and a number k. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters  if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by k. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string s. If such a string does not exist, output -1.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: 
1085	GCD of an Array You are given an array a of length n. You are asked to process q queries of the following format: given integers i and x, multiply a_i by x.After processing each query you need to output the  of all elements of the array a.Since the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo 10^9+7.
1086	Enormous XOR You are given two integers l and r in binary representation. Let g(x, y) be equal to the  of all integers from x to y inclusive (that is x \oplus (x+1) \oplus \dots \oplus (y-1) \oplus y). Let's define f(l, r) as the maximum of all values of g(x, y) satisfying l \le x \le y \le r.Output f(l, r).
1087	Enchanted Matrix There exists a matrix a of size n \times m (n rows and m columns), you know only numbers n and m. The rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the matrix are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the x-th row and the y-th column is denoted as (x, y).You are asked to find the number of pairs (r, c) (1 \le r \le n, 1 \le c \le m, r is a divisor of n, c is a divisor of m) such that if we split the matrix into rectangles of size r \times c (of height r rows and of width c columns, each cell belongs to exactly one rectangle), all those rectangles are pairwise equal.You can use queries of the following type: You can use at most  3 \cdot \left \lfloor{ \log_2{(n+m)} } \right \rfloor queries. All elements of the matrix a are fixed before the start of your program and do not depend on your queries.
1088	ABC String You are given a string a, consisting of n characters, n is even. For each i from 1 to n a_i is one of '', '' or ''.A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "" and "". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "" and "" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "" and "" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "" and ""), and "", "" and "" are not.You want to find a string b that consists of n characters such that: In other words, you want to replace all occurrences of '' with the same type of bracket, then all occurrences of '' with the same type of bracket and all occurrences of '' with the same type of bracket.Your task is to determine if such a string b exists.
1089	Berland Crossword Berland crossword is a puzzle that is solved on a square grid with n rows and n columns. Initially all the cells are white.To solve the puzzle one has to color some cells on the border of the grid black in such a way that: Note that you can color zero cells black and leave every cell white.Your task is to check if there exists a solution to the given puzzle.
1090	1D Sokoban You are playing a game similar to Sokoban on an infinite number line. The game is discrete, so you only consider integer positions on the line.You start on a position 0. There are n boxes, the i-th box is on a position a_i. All positions of the boxes are distinct. There are also m special positions, the j-th position is b_j. All the special positions are also distinct.In one move you can go one position to the left or to the right. If there is a box in the direction of your move, then you push the box to the next position in that direction. If the next position is taken by another box, then that box is also pushed to the next position, and so on. . .You are allowed to perform any number of moves (possibly, zero). Your goal is to place as many boxes on special positions as possible. Note that some boxes can be initially placed on special positions.
1091	Dogeforces The Dogeforces company has k employees. Each employee, except for lower-level employees, has at least 2 subordinates. Lower-level employees have no subordinates. Each employee, except for the head of the company, has exactly one direct supervisor. The head of the company is a direct or indirect supervisor of all employees. It is known that in Dogeforces, each supervisor receives a salary strictly more than all his subordinates.The full structure of the company is a secret, but you know the number of lower-level employees and for each pair of lower-level employees, the salary of their common supervisor is known (if there are several such supervisors, then the supervisor with the minimum salary). You have to restore the structure of the company.
1092	A-Z Graph You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices. Each directed edge (or arc) labeled with a single character. Initially, the graph is empty.You should process m queries with it. Each query is one of three types: 
1093	Delete The Edges You are given an undirected connected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. Your goal is to destroy all edges of the given graph.You may choose any vertex as the starting one and begin walking from it along the edges. When you walk along an edge, you destroy it. Obviously, you cannot walk along an edge if it is destroyed.You can perform the  operation at most once during your walk, and this operation can only be performed when you are at some vertex (you cannot perform it while traversing an edge). After the , the edges you go through are deleted in the following way: the first edge after the  is not destroyed, the second one is destroyed, the third one is not destroyed, the fourth one is destroyed, and so on. You cannot switch back to the original mode, and you don't have to perform this operation if you don't want to.Can you destroy all the edges of the given graph?
1094	Diamond Miner Diamond Miner is a game that is similar to Gold Miner, but there are n miners instead of 1 in this game.The mining area can be described as a plane. The n miners can be regarded as n points . There are n diamond mines in the mining area. We can regard them as n points . For some reason,  (point (0, 0)). Every miner should mine  one diamond mine. Every miner has a hook, which can be used to mine a diamond mine. If a miner at the point (a,b) uses his hook to mine a diamond mine at the point (c,d), he will spend \sqrt{(a-c)^2+(b-d)^2} energy to mine it (the distance between these points). The miners can't move or help each other.The object of this game is to minimize  that miners spend. Can you find this minimum?
1095	Let's Go Hiking On a weekend, Qingshan suggests that she and her friend Daniel go hiking. Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.A permutation p is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index x (1\le x\le n) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index y (1\le y\le n, y \ne x).The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow: The person who can't make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible x to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.
1096	Garden of the Sun There are many sunflowers in the Garden of the Sun.Garden of the Sun is a rectangular table with n rows and m columns, where the cells of the table are farmlands. All of the cells grow a sunflower on it. Unfortunately, one night, the lightning stroke some (possibly zero) cells, and sunflowers on those cells were burned into ashes. In other words, those cells struck by the lightning became empty. Magically,  (neither edges nor corners).Now the owner wants to remove some (possibly zero) sunflowers to reach the following two goals: You can walk from an empty cell to another if they share a common edge.Could you please give the owner a solution that meets all her requirements?Note that you are not allowed to plant sunflowers. You  to minimize the number of sunflowers you remove. It can be shown that the answer always exists.
1097	BFS Trees We define a spanning tree of a graph to be a BFS tree  vertex s if and only if for every node t the shortest distance between s and t in the graph is equal to the shortest distance between s and t in the spanning tree. Given a graph, we define f(x,y) to be the number of spanning trees of that graph that are BFS trees rooted at vertices x and y at the same time.You are given an undirected connected graph with n vertices and m edges. Calculate f(i,j) for all i, j by modulo 998\,244\,353.
1098	Qingshan and Daniel Qingshan and Daniel are going to play a card game. But it will be so boring if only two persons play this. So they will make n robots in total to play this game automatically. Robots made by Qingshan belong to the team 1, and robots made by Daniel belong to the team 2. Robot i belongs to team t_i. Before the game starts, a_i cards are given for robot i.The rules for this card game are simple: We define the distance from robot x to robot y as dist(x,y)=(y-x+n)\bmod n. It is similar to the oriented distance on the circle.For example, when n=5, the distance from 1 to 3 is dist(1,3)=(3-1+5)\bmod 5=2, the distance from 3 to 1 is dist(3,1)=(1-3+5)\bmod 5 =3.Later, Qingshan finds out that it will take so much time to see how robots play. She wants to know the result as quickly as possible. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate an array [ans_1,ans_2,\ldots,ans_n] — ans_i is equal to the number of cards, that i-th robot will discard during the game. You need to hurry!To avoid the large size of the input, the team and the number of cards of each robot will be generated in your code with some auxiliary arrays.
1099	Squares There are n squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The i-th square has three integers p_i,a_i,b_i, written on it. The sequence p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n forms a permutation.Each round you will start from the leftmost square 1 and jump to the right. If you are now on the i-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:There are q rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set S (initially it is empty). You  pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set S for the i-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the (i-1)-th round. For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.
1100	Split it! Kawashiro Nitori is a girl who loves competitive programming.One day she found a string and an integer. As an advanced problem setter, she quickly thought of a problem.Given a string s and a parameter k, you need to check if there exist k+1 non-empty strings a_1,a_2...,a_{k+1}, such that s=a_1+a_2+\ldots +a_k+a_{k+1}+R(a_k)+R(a_{k-1})+\ldots+R(a_{1}). Here + represents concatenation. We define R(x) as a reversed string x. For example R(abcd) = dcba. Note that in the formula above the part R(a_{k+1}) is intentionally skipped.
1101	Max and Mex You are given a multiset S initially consisting of n distinct non-negative integers. A multiset is a set, that can contain some elements multiple times.You will perform the following operation k times: Here \operatorname{max} of a multiset denotes the maximum integer in the multiset, and \operatorname{mex} of a multiset denotes the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the multiset. For example: Your task is to calculate the number of  elements in S after k operations will be done.
1102	Meximization You are given an integer n and an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. You should reorder the elements of the array a in such way that the sum of \textbf{MEX} on prefixes (i-th prefix is a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i) is maximized.Formally, you should find an array b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n, such that the sets of elements of arrays a and b are equal (it is equivalent to array b can be found as an array a with some reordering of its elements) and \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \textbf{MEX}(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_i) is maximized.\textbf{MEX} of a set of nonnegative integers is the minimal nonnegative integer such that it is not in the set.For example, \textbf{MEX}(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 0, \textbf{MEX}(\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\}) = 3.
1103	M-arrays You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n consisting of n positive integers and a positive integer m.You should divide elements of this array into some arrays. You can order the elements in the new arrays as you want.Let's call an array m-divisible if for each two adjacent numbers in the array (two numbers on the positions i and i+1 are called adjacent for each i) their sum is divisible by m. An array of one element is m-divisible.Find the smallest number of m-divisible arrays that a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n is possible to divide into.
1104	Genius There are n problems numbered with integers from 1 to n. i-th problem has the complexity c_i = 2^i, tag tag_i and score s_i.After solving the problem i it's allowed to solve problem j if and only if \text{IQ} < |c_i - c_j| and tag_i \neq tag_j. After solving it your \text{IQ} changes and becomes \text{IQ} = |c_i - c_j| and you gain |s_i - s_j| points.Any problem can be the first. You can solve problems in any order and as many times as you want.Initially your \text{IQ} = 0. Find the maximum number of points that can be earned.
1105	GCD Sum The \text{gcdSum} of a positive integer is the gcd of that integer with its sum of digits. Formally, \text{gcdSum}(x) = gcd(x, \text{ sum of digits of } x) for a positive integer x. gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b — the largest integer d such that both integers a and b are divisible by d.For example: \text{gcdSum}(762) = gcd(762, 7 + 6 + 2)=gcd(762,15) = 3.Given an integer n, find the smallest integer x \ge n such that \text{gcdSum}(x) > 1.
1106	Box Fitting You are given n rectangles, each of height 1. Each rectangle's width is a power of 2 (i. e. it can be represented as 2^x for some non-negative integer x). You are also given a two-dimensional box of width W. Note that W may or may not be a power of 2. Moreover, W is at least as large as the width of the largest rectangle.You have to find the smallest height of this box, such that it is able to fit all the given rectangles. It is allowed to have some empty space left in this box after fitting all the rectangles.You cannot rotate the given rectangles to make them fit into the box. Moreover, any two distinct rectangles must not overlap, i. e., any two distinct rectangles must have zero intersection area.See notes for visual explanation of sample input.
1107	Planar Reflections Gaurang has grown up in a mystical universe. He is faced by n consecutive 2D planes. He shoots a particle of decay age k at the planes.A particle can pass through a plane directly, however, every plane produces an identical copy of the particle going in the opposite direction with a decay age k-1. If a particle has decay age equal to 1, it will NOT produce a copy.For example, if there are two planes and a particle is shot with decay age 3 (towards the right), the process is as follows: (here, D(x) refers to a single particle with decay age x) In total, the final multiset S of particles is \{D(3), D(2), D(2), D(1)\}. (See notes for visual explanation of this test case.)Gaurang is unable to cope up with the complexity of this situation when the number of planes is too large. Help Gaurang find the size of the multiset S, given n and k.Since the size of the multiset can be very large, you have to output it modulo 10^9+7.Note: Particles can go back and forth between the planes without colliding with each other.
1108	Bananas in a Microwave You have a malfunctioning microwave in which you want to put some bananas. You have n time-steps before the microwave stops working completely. At each time-step, it displays a new operation.Let k be the number of bananas in the microwave currently. Initially, k = 0. In the i-th operation, you are given three parameters t_i, x_i, y_i in the input. Based on the value of t_i, you must do one of the following:: (t_i=1, x_i, y_i) — pick an a_i, such that 0 \le a_i \le y_i, and perform the following update a_i times: k:=\lceil (k + x_i) \rceil.: (t_i=2, x_i, y_i) — pick an a_i, such that 0 \le a_i \le y_i, and perform the following update a_i times: k:=\lceil (k \cdot x_i) \rceil.Note that . See input format for more details. Also, \lceil x \rceil is the smallest integer \ge x.At the i-th time-step, you must apply the i-th operation exactly once.For each j such that 1 \le j \le m, output the earliest time-step at which you can create  j bananas. If you cannot create  j bananas, output -1.
1109	Two Houses  You may use  in C++,  in Java,  in Python or  in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: .There is a city in which Dixit lives. In the city, there are n houses. There is  For example, consider two houses A and B, then there is a directed road either from A to B or from B to A but not both. The number of roads leading to the i-th house is k_i.Two houses A and B are  if A is reachable from B  B is reachable from A. We say that house B is reachable from house A when there is a path from house A to house B.Dixit wants to buy two houses in the city, that is, one for living and one for studying. Of course, he would like to travel from one house to another. So, he wants to find a pair of bi-reachable houses A and B. Among all such pairs, he wants to choose one with the maximum value of |k_A - k_B|, where k_i is the number of roads leading to the house i. If more than one optimal pair exists, any of them is suitable.Since Dixit is busy preparing CodeCraft, can you help him find the desired pair of houses, or tell him that no such houses exist?In the problem input, you are  given the direction of each road. You are given — for each house — only the number of incoming roads to that house (k_i).You are allowed to ask only one type of query from the judge: give two houses A and B, and the judge answers whether B is reachable from A. There is . But,  Also, you cannot ask the same query twice.Once you have exhausted all your queries (or the judge responds "" to any of your queries), your program must output its guess for the two houses and quit.See the Interaction section below for more details.
1110	Christmas Game Alice and Bob are going to celebrate Christmas by playing a game with a tree of presents. The tree has n nodes (numbered 1 to n, with some node r as its root). There are a_i presents are hanging from the i-th node.Before beginning the game, a special integer k is chosen. The game proceeds as follows: of the tree, find who among Alice or Bob wins the game.Note: The depth of a node i in a tree with root r is defined as the number of edges on the simple path from node r to node i. The depth of root r itself is zero.
1111	Domino on Windowsill You have a board represented as a grid with 2 \times n cells.The first k_1 cells on the first row and first k_2 cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.You have w white dominoes (2 \times 1 tiles, both cells are colored in white) and b black dominoes (2 \times 1 tiles, both cells are colored in black).You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.Can you place all w + b dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?
1112	Binary Removals You are given a string s, consisting only of characters '' or ''. Let |s| be the length of s.You are asked to choose some integer k (k > 0) and find a sequence a of length k such that: The characters at positions a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k are removed, the remaining characters are concatenated without changing the order. So, in other words, the positions in the sequence a should not be adjacent.Let the resulting string be s'. s' is called sorted if for all i from 2 to |s'| s'_{i-1} \le s'_i.Does there exist such a sequence a that the resulting string s' is sorted?
1113	Minimum Grid Path Let's say you are standing on the XY-plane at point (0, 0) and you want to reach point (n, n).You can move only in two directions: In other words, your path will have the following structure: You don't like to change your direction too much, so you will make no more than n - 1 direction changes.As a result, your path will be a polygonal chain from (0, 0) to (n, n), consisting of  n line segments where each segment has positive integer length and vertical and horizontal segments alternate.Not all paths are equal. You have n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n where c_i is the cost of the i-th segment.Using these costs we can define the  as the sum of lengths of the segments of this path multiplied by their cost, i. e. if the path consists of k segments (k \le n), then the cost of the path is equal to \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{c_i \cdot length_i} (segments are numbered from 1 to k in the order they are in the path).Find the path of the minimum cost and print its cost.
1114	The Number of Pairs You are given three positive (greater than zero) integers c, d and x. You have to find the number of pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that equality c \cdot lcm(a, b) - d \cdot gcd(a, b) = x holds. Where lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple of a and b and gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
1115	Chaotic Merge You are given two strings x and y, both consist only of lowercase Latin letters. Let |s| be the length of string s.Let's call a sequence a a merging sequence if it consists of exactly |x| zeros and exactly |y| ones in some order.A merge z is produced from a sequence a by the following rules: Two merging sequences a and b are different if there is some position i such that a_i \neq b_i.Let's call a string z  if for all i from 2 to |z| z_{i-1} \neq z_i.Let s[l,r] for some 1 \le l \le r \le |s| be a substring of consecutive letters of s, starting from position l and ending at position r inclusive.Let f(l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2) be the number of different merging sequences of x[l_1,r_1] and y[l_2,r_2] that produce  merges. Note that only non-empty substrings of x and y are considered.Calculate \sum \limits_{1 \le l_1 \le r_1 \le |x| \\ 1 \le l_2 \le r_2 \le |y|} f(l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2). Output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353.
1116	Diameter Cuts You are given an integer k and an undirected tree, consisting of n vertices.The length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between some pair of vertices is the number of edges in this path. A diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path between all pairs of vertices of this tree.You are about to remove a set of edges from the tree. The tree splits into multiple smaller trees when the edges are removed. The set of edges is valid if all the resulting trees have diameter less than or equal to k.Two sets of edges are different if there is an edge such that it appears in only one of the sets.Count the number of valid sets of edges modulo 998\,244\,353.
1117	Going Home It was the third month of remote learning, Nastya got sick of staying at dormitory, so she decided to return to her hometown. In order to make her trip more entertaining, one of Nastya's friend presented her an integer array a. Several hours after starting her journey home Nastya remembered about the present. To entertain herself she decided to check, are there four  indices x, y, z, w such that a_x + a_y = a_z + a_w.Her train has already arrived the destination, but she still hasn't found the answer. Can you help her unravel the mystery?
1118	Two chandeliers Vasya is a CEO of a big construction company. And as any other big boss he has a spacious, richly furnished office with two crystal chandeliers. To stay motivated Vasya needs the color of light at his office to change every day. That's why he ordered both chandeliers that can change its color cyclically. For example: red – brown – yellow – red – brown – yellow and so on. There are many chandeliers that differs in color set or order of colors. And the person responsible for the light made a critical mistake — they bought two different chandeliers.Since chandeliers are different, some days they will have the same color, but some days — different. Of course, it looks poor and only annoys Vasya. As a result, at the k-th time when chandeliers will light with different colors, Vasya will become very angry and, most probably, will fire the person who bought chandeliers.Your task is to calculate the day, when it happens (counting from the day chandeliers were installed). You can think that Vasya works every day without weekends and days off.
1119	Matrix Sorting You are given two tables A and B of size n \times m. We define a  as the following: we choose a column and reorder the rows of the table by the value in this column, from the rows with the smallest value to the rows with the largest. In case there are two or more rows with equal value in this column, their relative order does not change (such sorting algorithms are called ).You can find this behavior of sorting by column in many office software for managing spreadsheets. Petya works in one, and he has a table A opened right now. He wants to perform zero of more sortings by column to transform this table to table B.Determine if it is possible to do so, and if yes, find a sequence of columns to sort by. Note that you  to minimize the number of sortings.
1120	Tiles for Bathroom Kostya is extremely busy: he is renovating his house! He needs to hand wallpaper, assemble furniture throw away trash.Kostya is buying tiles for bathroom today. He is standing in front of a large square stand with tiles in a shop. The stand is a square of n \times n cells, each cell of which contains a small tile with color c_{i,\,j}. The shop sells tiles in packs: more specifically, you can only buy a subsquare of the initial square.A subsquare is any square part of the stand, i. e. any set S(i_0, j_0, k) = \{c_{i,\,j}\ |\ i_0 \le i < i_0 + k, j_0 \le j < j_0 + k\} with 1 \le i_0, j_0 \le n - k + 1.Kostya still does not know how many tiles he needs, so he considers the subsquares of all possible sizes. He doesn't want his bathroom to be too colorful. Help Kostya to count for each k \le n the number of subsquares of size k \times k that have at most q different colors of tiles. Two subsquares are considered different if their location on the stand is different.
1121	Subset Trick Vanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.Let an illusionist have a set of positive integers S. He names a positive integer x. Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of S without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed x. The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be 0.Vanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set of  positive integers S. Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number x , if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.Vanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set S.Vanya plans to try different sets S. He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set S, and after each change to the set S. Vanya will make q changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types: 
1122	Cupboards Jumps In the house where Krosh used to live, he had n cupboards standing in a line, the i-th cupboard had the height of h_i. Krosh moved recently, but he wasn't able to move the cupboards with him. Now he wants to buy n new cupboards so that they look as similar to old ones as possible.Krosh does not remember the exact heights of the cupboards, but for every three consecutive cupboards he remembers the height difference between the tallest and the shortest of them. In other words, if the cupboards' heights were h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n, then Krosh remembers the values w_i = \max(h_{i}, h_{i + 1}, h_{i + 2}) - \min(h_{i}, h_{i + 1}, h_{i + 2}) for all 1 \leq i \leq n - 2.Krosh wants to buy such n cupboards that all the values w_i remain the same. Help him determine the required cupboards' heights, or determine that he remembers something incorrectly and there is no suitable sequence of heights.
1123	Alexey and Train Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the train moves slower that it should!Alexey took the train at the railroad terminal. Let's say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment 0. Also, let's say that the train will visit n stations numbered from 1 to n along its way, and that Alexey destination is the station n.Alexey learned from the train schedule n integer pairs (a_i, b_i) where a_i is the expected time of train's arrival at the i-th station and b_i is the expected time of departure.Also, using all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate n integers tm_1, tm_2, \dots, tm_n where tm_i is the extra time the train need to travel from the station i - 1 to the station i. Formally, the train needs exactly a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i time to travel from station i - 1 to station i (if i = 1 then b_0 is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it's equal to 0).The train leaves the station i, if both conditions are met: Since Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of  at the station n.
1124	Napoleon Cake This week Arkady wanted to cook some pancakes (to follow ancient traditions) and make a problem about that. But then he remembered that one can't make a problem about stacking pancakes without working at a specific IT company, so he decided to bake the Napoleon cake instead.To bake a Napoleon cake, one has to bake n dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack, adding some cream. Arkady started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps n times: When x units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, top x layers of the cake get drenched in the cream. If there are less than x layers, all layers get drenched and the rest of the cream is wasted. If x = 0, no layer gets drenched.Help Arkady determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over, and which don't.
1125	Balance the Bits A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters '' and ''. For example, sequences '', '', and '' are balanced, while '', '', and '' are not.You are given a binary string s of length n. Construct two balanced bracket sequences a and b of length n such that for all 1\le i\le n: If it is impossible, you should report about it.
1126	3-Coloring Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is n\times n grid, initially empty. We refer to the cell in row i and column j by (i, j) for 1\le i, j\le n. There is an infinite supply of tokens that come in 3 colors labelled 1, 2, and 3.The game proceeds with turns as follows. Each turn begins with Alice naming one of the three colors, let's call it a. Then, Bob chooses a color b\ne a, chooses an empty cell, and places a token of color b on that cell.We say that there is a  if there exist two adjacent cells containing tokens of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common edge.If at any moment there is a conflict, Alice wins. Otherwise, if n^2 turns are completed (so that the grid becomes full) without any conflicts, Bob wins.We have a proof that Bob has a winning strategy. Play the game as Bob and win.The interactor is . That is, Alice's color choices can depend on Bob's previous moves.
1127	Travelling Salesman Problem There are n cities numbered from 1 to n, and city i has beauty a_i.A salesman wants to start at city 1, visit every city exactly once, and return to city 1.For all i\ne j, a flight from city i to city j costs \max(c_i,a_j-a_i) dollars, where c_i is the price floor enforced by city i. Note that there is no absolute value. Find the minimum total cost for the salesman to complete his trip.
1128	Flip the Cards There is a deck of n cards. The i-th card has a number a_i on the front and a number b_i on the back. Every integer between 1 and 2n appears exactly once on the cards.A deck is called sorted if the front values are in  order and the back values are in  order. That is, if a_i< a_{i+1} and b_i> b_{i+1} for all 1\le i<n.To flip a card i means swapping the values of a_i and b_i. You must flip some subset of cards (possibly, none), then put all the cards in any order you like. What is the minimum number of cards you must flip in order to sort the deck?
1129	2-Coloring There is a grid with n rows and m columns. Every cell of the grid should be colored either blue or yellow.A coloring of the grid is called stupid if every row has exactly one segment of blue cells and every column has exactly one segment of yellow cells.In other words, every row must have at least one blue cell, and all blue cells in a row must be consecutive. Similarly, every column must have at least one yellow cell, and all yellow cells in a column must be consecutive.How many stupid colorings of the grid are there? Two colorings are considered different if there is some cell that is colored differently.
1130	Balance the Cards A balanced bracket sequence is defined as an integer sequence that can be built with the following rules:The positive numbers can be imagined as opening brackets and the negative numbers as closing brackets, where matching brackets must have the same type (absolute value). For example, [1, 2, -2, -1] and [1, 3, -3, 2, -2, -1] are balanced, but [1, 2, -1, -2] and [-1, 1] are not balanced.There are 2n cards. Each card has a number on the front and a number on the back. Each integer 1,-1,2,-2,\ldots,n,-n appears exactly once on the front of some card and exactly once on the back of some (not necessarily the same) card.You can reorder the cards however you like. You are  allowed to flip cards, so numbers cannot move between the front and back. Your task is to order the cards so that the sequences given by the front numbers and the back numbers are both balanced, or report that it is impossible.
1131	 Déjà Vu A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings "", "", "", and "" are palindromes, but "" and "" are not. You hate palindromes because they give you déjà vu.There is a string s. You  insert  character '' somewhere in s. If it is possible to create a string that is  a palindrome, you should find one example. Otherwise, you should report that it is impossible.For example, suppose s= "". By inserting an '', you can create "", "", "", "", or "". However "" is a palindrome, so you must output one of the other options.
1132	Flip the Bits There is a binary string a of length n. In one operation, you can select any prefix of a with an  number of 0 and 1 symbols. Then all symbols in the prefix are inverted: each 0 becomes 1 and each 1 becomes 0.For example, suppose a=0111010000. Can you transform the string a into the string b using some finite number of operations (possibly, none)?
1133	Strange Table Polycarp found a rectangular table consisting of n rows and m columns. He noticed that each cell of the table has its number, obtained by the following algorithm : For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, the table will be numbered as follows: \begin{matrix} 1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 13 \\ 2 & 5 & 8 & 11 & 14 \\ 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 \\ \end{matrix} However, Polycarp considers such numbering inconvenient. He likes the numbering : For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, then Polycarp likes the following table numbering:  \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\ \end{matrix} Polycarp doesn't have much time, so he asks you to find out what would be the cell number in the numbering , if in the numbering  the cell has the number x?
1134	Partial Replacement You are given a number k and a string s of length n, consisting of the characters '' and ''. You want to replace some of the '' characters with '' characters so that the following conditions are met: For example, if n=7, s= and k=3, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above: Given n, k, and s, find the minimum number of '' characters that must be replaced with '' in order to meet the above conditions.
1135	Double-ended Strings You are given the strings a and b, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You can do any number of the following operations in any order: Note that after each of the operations, the string a or b may become empty.For example, if a= and b=, then you can apply the following sequence of operations: For the given strings a and b, find the minimum number of operations for which you can make the strings a and b equal. Note that empty strings are also equal.
1136	Epic Transformation You are given an array a of length n consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array a  or more times: For example, if n=6 and a=[1, 6, 1, 1, 4, 4], then you can perform the following sequence of operations: What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?
1137	Restoring the Permutation A permutation is a sequence of n integers from 1 to n, in which all numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1], [3, 5, 2, 1, 4], [1, 3, 2] are permutations, and [2, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1], [0] are not.Polycarp was presented with a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. However, when Polycarp came home, he noticed that in his pocket, the permutation p had turned into an array q according to the following rule: Now Polycarp wondered what lexicographically minimal and lexicographically maximal permutations could be presented to him.An array a of length n is lexicographically smaller than an array b of length n if there is an index i (1 \le i \le n) such that the first i-1 elements of arrays a and b are the same, and the i-th element of the array a is less than the i-th element of the array b. For example, the array a=[1, 3, 2, 3] is lexicographically smaller than the array b=[1, 3, 4, 2].For example, if n=7 and p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 7, 5, 6], then q=[3, 3, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7] and the following permutations could have been as p initially: For a given array q, find the lexicographically minimal and lexicographically maximal permutations that could have been originally presented to Polycarp.
1138	Triangular Paths Consider an infinite triangle made up of layers. Let's number the layers, starting from one, from the top of the triangle (from top to bottom). The k-th layer of the triangle contains k points, numbered from left to right. Each point of an infinite triangle is described by a pair of numbers (r, c) (1 \le c \le r), where r is the number of the layer, and c is the number of the point in the layer. From each point (r, c) there are two  edges to the points (r+1, c) and (r+1, c+1), but only one of the edges is activated. If r + c is even, then the edge to the point (r+1, c) is activated, otherwise the edge to the point (r+1, c+1) is activated. Look at the picture for a better understanding.From the point (r_1, c_1) it is possible to reach the point (r_2, c_2), if there is a path between them only from  edges. For example, in the picture above, there is a path from (1, 1) to (3, 2), but there is no path from (2, 1) to (1, 1).Initially, you are at the point (1, 1). For each turn, you can: You are given a sequence of n points of an infinite triangle (r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), \ldots, (r_n, c_n). Find the minimum cost path from (1, 1), passing through all n points in  order.
1139	Binary Literature A bitstring is a string that contains only the characters  and .Koyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in the . The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length 2n. A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most 3n that contains  of the three given strings as subsequences.Koyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest.A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.
1140	Almost Sorted Seiji Maki doesn't only like to observe relationships being unfolded, he also likes to observe sequences of numbers, especially permutations. Today, he has his eyes on  permutations.A permutation a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n of 1, 2, \dots, n is said to be  if the condition a_{i + 1} \ge a_i - 1 holds for all i between 1 and n - 1 inclusive.Maki is considering the list of all almost sorted permutations of 1, 2, \dots, n, given in lexicographical order, and he wants to find the k-th permutation in this list. Can you help him to find such permutation?Permutation p is lexicographically smaller than a permutation q if and only if the following holds:
1141	Complete the MST As a teacher, Riko Hakozaki often needs to help her students with problems from various subjects. Today, she is asked a programming task which goes as follows.You are given an undirected complete graph with n nodes, where some edges are pre-assigned with a positive weight while the rest aren't. You need to assign all unassigned edges with  so that in the resulting fully-assigned complete graph the  sum of all weights would be equal to 0.Define the  of a fully-assigned complete graph the weight of its , where the weight of a spanning tree equals the sum of weights of its edges. You need to assign the weights so that the ugliness of the resulting graph is as small as possible.As a reminder, an undirected complete graph with n nodes contains all edges (u, v) with 1 \le u < v \le n; such a graph has \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.She is not sure how to solve this problem, so she asks you to solve it for her.
1142	Swap Pass You are given n points on the plane, no three of which are collinear. The i-th point initially has a label a_i, in such a way that the labels a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n form a permutation of 1, 2, \dots, n.You are allowed to modify the labels through the following operation:A sequence of operations is valid if after applying all of the operations in the sequence in order, the k-th point ends up having the label k for all k between 1 and n inclusive, and the drawn segments don't intersect each other internally. Formally, if two of the segments intersect, then they must do so at a common endpoint of both segments.In particular, all drawn segments must be distinct.Find any valid sequence of operations, or say that none exist. 
1143	Tree Calendar Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami are newlyweds! On the wedding day, Yuu gifted Touko a directed tree with n nodes and rooted at 1, and a labeling a which is  DFS order of the tree. Every edge in this tree is directed away from the root.After calling  the following algorithm returns a as a DFS order of a tree rooted at 1 :Note that there may be different DFS orders for a given tree.Touko likes the present so much she decided to play with it! On each day following the wedding day, Touko performs this procedure once:Days have passed since their wedding, and Touko has somehow forgotten which date the wedding was and what was the original labeling a! Fearing that Yuu might get angry, Touko decided to ask you to derive these two pieces of information using the current labeling.Being her good friend, you need to find the number of days that have passed since the wedding, and the original labeling of the tree. However, there is a chance that Touko might have messed up her procedures, which result in the current labeling being impossible to obtain from some original labeling; in that case, please inform Touko as well.
1144	Optimal Encoding Touko's favorite sequence of numbers is a permutation a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n of 1, 2, \dots, n, and she wants some collection of permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation.She has a collection of q intervals of the form [l_i, r_i] with 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n. To create permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation, she coined the following definition:Yuu wants to figure out all k-similar permutations for Touko, but it turns out this is a very hard task; instead, Yuu will  the set of all k-similar permutations with directed acylic graphs (DAG). Yuu also coined the following definitions for herself:Since Yuu is free today, she wants to figure out the minimum number of edges among all k-encodings for each k from 1 to q.
1145	Average Height Sayaka Saeki is a member of the student council, which has n other members (excluding Sayaka). The i-th member has a height of a_i millimeters.It's the end of the school year and Sayaka wants to take a picture of all other members of the student council. Being the hard-working and perfectionist girl as she is, she wants to arrange all the members in a line such that the amount of  consecutive pairs of members is .A pair of two consecutive members u and v on a line is considered  if their average height is an integer, i.e. \frac{a_u + a_v}{2} is an integer.Help Sayaka arrange the other members to  the number of photogenic consecutive pairs.
1146	TMT Document The student council has a shared document file. Every day, some members of the student council write the sequence  (short for Towa Maji Tenshi) in it.However, one day, the members somehow entered the sequence into the document at the same time, creating a jumbled mess. Therefore, it is Suguru Doujima's task to figure out whether the document has malfunctioned. Specifically, he is given a string of length n whose characters are all either  or , and he wants to figure out if it is possible to partition it into some number of disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to . That is, each character of the string should belong to exactly one of the subsequences.A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.
1147	The Sports Festival The student council is preparing for the relay race at the sports festival.The council consists of n members. They will run one after the other in the race, the speed of member i is s_i. The  d_i of the i-th stage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum running speed among the first i members who ran. Formally, if a_i denotes the speed of the i-th member who participated in the race, then d_i = \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_i) - \min(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_i).You want to minimize the sum of the discrepancies d_1 + d_2 + \dots + d_n. To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?
1148	Button Lock You are standing in front of the room with great treasures. The only thing stopping you is the door with a push-button combination lock. This lock has d buttons with digits from 0 to d - 1. Whenever you press a button, it stays pushed down. You can not pop back up just one button, but there is a "RESET" button — pressing it pops up all other buttons. Initially, no buttons are pushed down.The door instantly opens when some specific set of digits is pushed down. Sadly, you don't know the password for it. Having read the documentation for this specific lock, you found out that there are n possible passwords for this particular lock. Find the shortest sequence of button presses, such that all possible passwords appear at least once during its execution. Any shortest correct sequence of button presses will be accepted.
1149	Cactus Not Enough There was no problem about a cactus at the NERC 2020 online round. That's a bad mistake, so judges decided to fix it. You shall not pass to the World Finals 2021 without solving a problem about a cactus!A  is a connected undirected graph in which every edge lies on at most one simple cycle. Intuitively, a cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Multiedges (multiple edges between a pair of vertices) and loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself) are not allowed in a cactus. Cher has got a cactus. She calls cactus  if it is impossible to add an edge to it in such a way that it still remains a cactus. But Cher thinks her cactus is not strong enough. She wants to add the smallest possible number of edges to it to make it strong, i. e. to create a new cactus with the same vertices, so that the original cactus is a subgraph of the new one, and it is impossible to add another edge to it so that the graph remains a cactus. Cher hired you to do this job for her. So... it's on you!
1150	Digits Diana loves playing with numbers. She's got n cards with positive integer numbers a_i written on them. She spends her free time multiplying the numbers on the cards. She picks a non-empty subset of the cards and multiplies all the numbers a_i written on them.Diana is happy when the product of the numbers ends with her favorite digit d. Now she is curious what cards she should pick so that the product of the numbers on them is the largest possible and the last decimal digit of the product is d. Please, help her.
1151	Review Site You are an upcoming movie director, and you have just released your first movie. You have also launched a simple review site with two buttons to press — upvote and downvote.However, the site is not so simple on the inside. There are two servers, each with its separate counts for the upvotes and the downvotes.n reviewers enter the site one by one. Each reviewer is one of the following types: Each reviewer votes on the movie exactly once.Since you have two servers, you can actually manipulate the votes so that your movie gets as many upvotes as possible. When a reviewer enters a site, you know their type, and you can send them either to the first server or to the second one.What is the maximum total number of upvotes you can gather over both servers if you decide which server to send each reviewer to?
1152	GCD Length You are given three integers a, b and c.Find two positive integers x and y (x > 0, y > 0) such that: gcd(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y.Output x and y. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
1153	Yet Another Card Deck You have a card deck of n cards, numbered from top to bottom, i. e. the top card has index 1 and bottom card — index n. Each card has its color: the i-th card has color a_i.You should process q queries. The j-th query is described by integer t_j. For each query you should: 
1154	Min Cost String Let's define the  of a string s as the number of index pairs i and j (1 \le i < j < |s|) such that s_i = s_j and s_{i+1} = s_{j+1}.You are given two positive integers n and k. Among all strings with length n that contain only the first k characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible . If there are multiple such strings with minimum  — find any of them.
1155	Colorings and Dominoes You have a large rectangular board which is divided into n \times m cells (the board has n rows and m columns). Each cell is either white or black.You paint each white cell either red or blue. Obviously, the number of different ways to paint them is 2^w, where w is the number of white cells.After painting the white cells of the board, you want to place the maximum number of dominoes on it, according to the following rules:Let the  of the board be the maximum number of dominoes you can place. Calculate the sum of  of the board over all 2^w possible ways to paint it. Since it can be huge, print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1156	Chainword A chainword is a special type of crossword. As most of the crosswords do, it has cells that you put the letters in and some sort of hints to what these letters should be.The letter cells in a chainword are put in a single row. We will consider chainwords of length m in this task.A hint to a chainword is a sequence of segments such that the segments don't intersect with each other and cover all m letter cells. Each segment contains a description of the word in the corresponding cells.The twist is that there are actually two hints: one sequence is the row above the letter cells and the other sequence is the row below the letter cells. When the sequences are different, they provide a way to resolve the ambiguity in the answers.You are provided with a dictionary of n words, each word consists of lowercase Latin letters. All words are pairwise distinct.An instance of a chainword is the following triple: Note that the sequences of segments don't necessarily have to be distinct.Two instances of chainwords are considered different if they have different strings, different first hints  different second hints.Count the number of different instances of chainwords. Since the number might be pretty large, output it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1157	Spy Detected! You are given an array a consisting of n (n \ge 3) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array [4, 11, 4, 4] all numbers except one are equal to 4).Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.
1158	Almost Rectangle There is a square field of size n \times n in which two cells are marked. These cells can be in the same row or column.You are to mark two more cells so that they are the corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.For example, if n=4 and a rectangular field looks like this (there are asterisks in the marked cells): \begin{matrix} . & . & * & . \\ . & . & . & . \\ * & . & . & . \\ . & . & . & . \\ \end{matrix} Then you can mark two more cells as follows \begin{matrix} * & . & * & . \\ . & . & . & . \\ * & . & * & . \\ . & . & . & . \\ \end{matrix} If there are several possible solutions, then print any of them.
1159	A-B Palindrome You are given a string s consisting of the characters '', '', and ''. You need to replace all the characters with '' in the string s by '' or '' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has  a characters '' and  b characters ''. Note that each of the characters '' is replaced  from the others.A string t of length n is called a palindrome if the equality t[i] = t[n-i+1] is true for all i (1 \le i \le n).For example, if s="", a=4 and b=4, then you can replace the characters '' in the following ways: For the given string s and the numbers a and b, replace all the characters with '' in the string s by '' or '' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has  a characters '' and  b characters ''.
1160	Corrupted Array You are given a number n and an array b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n+2}, obtained according to the following algorithm: For example, the array b=[2, 3, 7, 12 ,2] it could be obtained in the following ways: For the given array b, find any array a that could have been guessed initially.
1161	Permutation by Sum A permutation is a sequence of n integers from 1 to n, in which all the numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1], [3, 5, 2, 1, 4], [1, 3, 2] are permutations, and [2, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1], [0] are not.Polycarp was given four integers n, l, r (1 \le l \le r \le n) and s (1 \le s \le \frac{n (n+1)}{2}) and asked to find a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n that satisfies the following condition: For example, for n=5, l=3, r=5, and s=8, the following permutations are suitable (not all options are listed): Help Polycarp, for the given n, l, r, and s, find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n that fits the condition above. If there are several suitable permutations, print any of them.
1162	Education Polycarp is wondering about buying a new computer, which costs c tugriks. To do this, he wants to get a job as a programmer in a big company.There are n positions in Polycarp's company, numbered starting from one. An employee in position i earns a[i] tugriks every day. The higher the position number, the more tugriks the employee receives. Initially, Polycarp gets a position with the number 1 and has 0 tugriks.Each day Polycarp can do one of two things: For example, if n=4, c=15, a=[1, 3, 10, 11], b=[1, 2, 7], then Polycarp can act like this: Find the minimum number of days after which Polycarp will be able to buy himself a new computer.
1163	Array and Peaks A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.Given two integers n and k, construct a permutation a of numbers from 1 to n which has  k peaks. An index i of an array a of size n is said to be a peak if 1 < i < n and a_i \gt a_{i-1} and a_i \gt a_{i+1}. If such permutation is not possible, then print -1.
1164	AND Sequences A sequence of n non-negative integers (n \ge 2) a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n is called good if for all i from 1 to n-1 the following condition holds true: a_1 \: \& \: a_2 \: \& \: \dots \: \& \: a_i = a_{i+1} \: \& \: a_{i+2} \: \& \: \dots \: \& \: a_n, where \& denotes the .You are given an array a of size n (n \geq 2). Find the number of permutations p of numbers ranging from 1 to n, for which the sequence a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, ... ,a_{p_n} is good. Since this number can be large, output it modulo 10^9+7.
1165	Add One You are given an integer n. You have to apply m operations to it.In a single operation, you  replace every digit d of the number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. For example, 1912 becomes 21023 after applying the operation once.You have to find the length of n after applying m operations. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
1166	GCD and MST You are given an array a of n (n \geq 2) positive integers and an integer p. Consider an undirected weighted graph of n vertices numbered from 1 to n for which the edges between the vertices i and j (i<j) are added in the following manner:Here gcd(x, y, \ldots) denotes the  of integers x, y, ....Note that there could be multiple edges between i and j if both of the above conditions are true, and if both the conditions fail for i and j, then there is no edge between these vertices.The goal is to find the weight of the  of this graph.
1167	Cost Equilibrium An array is called beautiful if all the elements in the array are equal.You can transform an array using the following steps any number of times: For example, array [0, 2, 3, 3] can be transformed into a beautiful array [2, 2, 2, 2] with total cost 1 \cdot |1-3| + 1 \cdot |1-4| = 5.An array is called balanced, if it can be transformed into a beautiful array, and the cost of such transformation is  defined. In other words, the minimum cost of transformation into a beautiful array equals the maximum cost.You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the number of balanced arrays which are permutations of the given array. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.
1168	Swapping Problem You are given 2 arrays a and b, both of size n. You can swap two elements in b at most  (or leave it as it is), and you are required to minimize the value \sum_{i}|a_{i}-b_{i}|.Find the minimum possible value of this sum.
1169	Perfectly Imperfect Array Given an array a of length n, tell us whether it has a non-empty subsequence such that the product of its elements is  a perfect square.A sequence b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deleting some (possibly zero) elements.
1170	AND 0, Sum Big Baby Badawy's first words were "AND 0 SUM BIG", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers n and k, count the number of arrays of length n such that:Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 10^9+7.
1171	Product 1 Modulo N Now you get Baby Ehab's first words: "Given an integer n, find the longest subsequence of [1,2, \ldots, n-1] whose product is 1 modulo n." Please solve the problem.A sequence b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deleting some (possibly all) elements. The product of an empty subsequence is equal to 1.
1172	Cut and Stick Baby Ehab has a piece of Cut and Stick with an array a of length n written on it. He plans to grab a pair of scissors and do the following to it:More formally, he partitions the sequence a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r into subsequences. He thinks a partitioning is beautiful if for every piece (subsequence) it holds that, if it has length x, then no value occurs strictly more than \lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil times in it.He didn't pick a range yet, so he's wondering: for q ranges (l, r), what is the minimum number of pieces he needs to partition the elements a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r into so that the partitioning is beautiful.A sequence b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deleting some (possibly zero) elements. Note that it does  have to be contiguous.
1173	Baby Ehab's Hyper Apartment Baby Ehab loves crawling around his apartment. It has n rooms numbered from 0 to n-1. For every pair of rooms, a and b, there's either a direct passage from room a to room b, or from room b to room a, but never both.Baby Ehab wants to go play with Baby Badawy. He wants to know if he could get to him. However, he doesn't know anything about his apartment except the number of rooms. He can ask the baby sitter two types of questions: He can ask at most 9n queries of the first type and at most 2n queries of the second type.After asking some questions, he wants to know for every pair of rooms a and b whether there's a path from a to b or not. A path from a to b is a sequence of passages that starts from room a and ends at room b.
1174	Phoenix and Gold Phoenix has collected n pieces of gold, and he wants to weigh them together so he can feel rich. The i-th piece of gold has weight w_i. All weights are . He will put his n pieces of gold on a weight scale, one piece at a time. The scale has an unusual defect: if the total weight on it is  x, it will explode. Can he put all n gold pieces onto the scale in some order, without the scale exploding during the process? If so, help him find some possible order. Formally, rearrange the array w so that for each i (1 \le i \le n), \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{i}w_j \ne x.
1175	Phoenix and Puzzle Phoenix is playing with a new puzzle, which consists of n identical puzzle pieces. Each puzzle piece is a right isosceles triangle as shown below.The goal of the puzzle is to create a  using the n pieces. He is allowed to rotate and move the pieces around, but none of them can overlap and all n pieces must be used (of course, the square shouldn't contain any holes as well). Can he do it?
1176	Phoenix and Towers Phoenix has n blocks of height h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n, and all h_i don't exceed some value x. He plans to stack all n blocks into m separate towers. The height of a tower is simply the sum of the heights of its blocks. For the towers to look beautiful, no two towers may have a height difference of strictly more than x. Please help Phoenix build m towers that look beautiful. Each tower must have  and all blocks must be used.
1177	Phoenix and Socks To satisfy his love of matching socks, Phoenix has brought his n socks (n is even) to the sock store. Each of his socks has a color c_i and is either a left sock or right sock. Phoenix can pay one dollar to the sock store to either: The sock store may perform each of these changes any number of times. Note that the color of a left sock doesn't change when it turns into a right sock, and vice versa. A matching pair of socks is a left and right sock with the same color. What is the minimum cost for Phoenix to make n/2 matching pairs? Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.
1178	Phoenix and Computers There are n computers in a row, all originally off, and Phoenix wants to turn all of them on. He will manually turn on computers one at a time. At any point, if computer i-1 and computer i+1 are both on, computer i (2 \le i \le n-1) will turn on automatically if it is not already on. Note that Phoenix cannot manually turn on a computer that already turned on automatically.If we only consider the sequence of computers that Phoenix turns on manually, how many ways can he turn on all the computers? Two sequences are distinct if either the set of computers turned on manually is distinct, or the order of computers turned on manually is distinct. Since this number may be large, please print it modulo M.
1179	Phoenix and Earthquake Phoenix's homeland, the Fire Nation had n cities that were connected by m roads, but the roads were all destroyed by an earthquake. The Fire Nation wishes to repair n-1 of these roads so that all the cities are connected again. The i-th city has a_i tons of asphalt. x tons of asphalt are used up when repairing a road, and to repair a road between i and j, cities i and j must have at least x tons of asphalt between them. In other words, if city i had a_i tons of asphalt and city j had a_j tons, there would remain a_i+a_j-x tons after repairing the road between them. Asphalt can be moved between cities if the road between them is already repaired.Please determine if it is possible to connect all the cities, and if so, output any sequence of roads to repair.
1180	Tit for Tat Given an array a of length n, you can do at most k operations of the following type on it:What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?An array x is  than an array y if there exists an index i such that x_i<y_i, and x_j=y_j for all 1 \le j < i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, x_i<y_i.
1181	AGAGA XOOORRR Baby Ehab is known for his love for a certain operation. He has an array a of length n, and he decided to keep doing the following operation on it: Now he asks you if he can make all elements of the array equal. Since babies like to make your life harder, he requires that you leave at least 2 elements remaining.
1182	Baby Ehab Partitions Again Baby Ehab was toying around with arrays. He has an array a of length n. He defines an array to be good if there's no way to partition it into 2 subsequences such that the sum of the elements in the first is equal to the sum of the elements in the second. Now he wants to remove the minimum number of elements in a so that it becomes a good array. Can you help him?A sequence b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements. A partitioning of an array is a way to divide it into 2 subsequences such that every element belongs to exactly one subsequence, so you must use all the elements, and you can't share any elements.
1183	Cut This time Baby Ehab will only cut and not stick. He starts with a piece of paper with an array a of length n written on it, and then he does the following:Formally, he partitions the elements of a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r into contiguous subarrays such that the product of every subarray is equal to its LCM. Now, for q independent ranges (l, r), tell Baby Ehab the minimum number of subarrays he needs.
1184	Baby Ehab Plays with Permutations This time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has n cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from 1 to n written on them. He'll make  j operations. In each operation, he'll pick up 2 cubes and switch their positions.He's wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he doesn't know how many operations he'll make, so he wants the answer for every possible j between 1 and k.
1185	Sum of 2050 A number is called  if it is 2050, 20500, ..., (2050 \cdot 10^k for integer k \ge 0).Given a number n, you are asked to represent n as the sum of some (not necessarily distinct) 2050-numbers. Compute the minimum number of 2050-numbers required for that.
1186	Morning Jogging The 2050 volunteers are organizing the "Run! Chase the Rising Sun" activity. Starting on Apr 25 at 7:30 am, runners will complete the 6km trail around the Yunqi town.There are n+1 checkpoints on the trail. They are numbered by 0, 1, ..., n. A runner must start at checkpoint 0 and finish at checkpoint n. No checkpoint is skippable — he must run from checkpoint 0 to checkpoint 1, then from checkpoint 1 to checkpoint 2 and so on. Look at the picture in notes section for clarification.Between any two adjacent checkpoints, there are m different paths to choose. For any 1\le i\le n, to run from checkpoint i-1 to checkpoint i, a runner can choose exactly one from the m possible paths. The length of the j-th path between checkpoint i-1 and i is b_{i,j} for any 1\le j\le m and 1\le i\le n.To test the trail, we have m runners. Each runner must run from the checkpoint 0 to the checkpoint n once, visiting all the checkpoints. Every path between every pair of adjacent checkpoints needs to be ran by  runner. If a runner chooses the path of length l_i between checkpoint i-1 and i (1\le i\le n), his  is \min_{i=1}^n l_i, i. e. the minimum length of the paths he takes.Please arrange the paths of the m runners to minimize the sum of tiredness of them.
1187	Fillomino 2 Fillomino is a classic logic puzzle. (You do not need to know Fillomino in order to solve this problem.) In one classroom in Yunqi town, some volunteers are playing a board game variant of it:Consider an n by n chessboard. Its rows are numbered from 1 to n from the top to the bottom. Its columns are numbered from 1 to n from the left to the right. A cell on an intersection of x-th row and y-th column is denoted (x, y). The main diagonal of the chessboard is cells (x, x) for all 1 \le x \le n.A permutation of \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\} is written on the main diagonal of the chessboard. There is exactly one number written on each of the cells. The problem is to partition the cells under and on the main diagonal (there are exactly 1+2+ \ldots +n such cells) into n connected regions satisfying the following constraints:
1188	Explorer Space You are wandering in the explorer space of the 2050 Conference.The explorer space can be viewed as an undirected weighted grid graph with size n\times m. The set of vertices is \{(i, j)|1\le i\le n, 1\le j\le m\}. Two vertices (i_1,j_1) and (i_2, j_2) are connected by an edge if and only if |i_1-i_2|+|j_1-j_2|=1.At each step, you can walk to any vertex connected by an edge with your current vertex. On each edge, there are some number of exhibits. Since you already know all the exhibits, whenever you go through an edge containing x exhibits, your  increases by x.For each starting vertex (i, j), please answer the following question: What is the minimum possible boredness if you walk from (i, j) and go back to it after exactly k steps?You can use any edge for multiple times but the boredness on those edges are also counted for multiple times. At each step, you cannot stay on your current vertex. You also cannot change direction while going through an edge. Before going back to your starting vertex (i, j) after k steps, you can visit (i, j) (or not) freely.
1189	Group Photo In the 2050 Conference, some people from the competitive programming community meet together and are going to take a photo. The n people form a line. They are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each of them either holds a cardboard with the letter '' or a cardboard with the letter ''.Let C=\{c_1,c_2,\dots,c_m\} (c_1<c_2<\ldots <c_m) be the set of people who hold cardboards of ''. Let P=\{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k\} (p_1<p_2<\ldots <p_k) be the set of people who hold cardboards of ''. The photo is good if and only if it satisfies the following constraints: Given an array a_1,\ldots, a_n, please find the number of good photos satisfying the following condition: \sum\limits_{x\in C} a_x < \sum\limits_{y\in P} a_y.The answer can be large, so output it modulo 998\,244\,353. Two photos are different if and only if there exists at least one person who holds a cardboard of '' in one photo but holds a cardboard of '' in the other.
1190	Reunion It is reported that the 2050 Conference will be held in Yunqi Town in Hangzhou from April 23 to 25, including theme forums, morning jogging, camping and so on.The relationship between the n volunteers of the 2050 Conference can be represented by a tree (a connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges). The n vertices of the tree corresponds to the n volunteers and are numbered by 1,2,\ldots, n.We define the distance between two volunteers i and j, (i,j) as the number of edges on the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j on the tree. (i,j)=0 whenever i=j.Some of the volunteers can attend the on-site reunion while others cannot. If for some volunteer x and nonnegative integer r, all volunteers whose distance to x is no more than r can attend the on-site reunion, a forum with radius r can take place. The  of the on-site reunion is defined as the maximum possible radius of any forum that can take place.Assume that each volunteer can attend the on-site reunion with probability \frac{1}{2} and these events are independent. Output the expected level of the on-site reunion. When no volunteer can attend, the level is defined as -1. When all volunteers can attend, the level is defined as n. 
1191	Red and Blue Beans You have r red and b blue beans. You'd like to distribute them among several (maybe, one) packets in such a way that each packet: Can you distribute all beans?
1192	The Cake Is a Lie There is a n \times m grid. You are standing at cell (1, 1) and your goal is to finish at cell (n, m).You can move to the neighboring cells to the right or down. In other words, suppose you are standing at cell (x, y). You can: Can you reach cell (n, m) spending  k burles?
1193	Berland Regional Polycarp is an organizer of a Berland ICPC regional event. There are n universities in Berland numbered from 1 to n. Polycarp knows all competitive programmers in the region. There are n students: the i-th student is enrolled at a university u_i and has a programming skill s_i.Polycarp has to decide on the rules now. In particular, the number of members in the team.Polycarp knows that if he chooses the size of the team to be some integer k, each university will send their k strongest (with the highest programming skill s) students in the first team, the next k strongest students in the second team and so on. If there are fewer than k students left, then the team can't be formed. Note that there might be universities that send zero teams.The strength of the region is the total skill of the members of all present teams. If there are no teams present, then the strength is 0.Help Polycarp to find the strength of the region for each choice of k from 1 to n.
1194	Maximum Sum of Products You are given two integer arrays a and b of length n.You can reverse  subarray (continuous subsegment) of the array a. Your task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum \sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot b_i is .
1195	Off by One There are n points on an infinite plane. The i-th point has coordinates (x_i, y_i) such that x_i > 0 and y_i > 0. The coordinates are not necessarily integer.In one move you perform the following operations:  Otherwise, the move can't be performed and the points stay at their original coordinates (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b), respectively.The numeration of points  after some points are removed. Once the points are removed, they can't be chosen in any later moves. Note that you have to move both points during the move, you can't leave them at their original coordinates.What is the maximum number of moves you can perform? What are these moves?If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
1196	Chests and Keys Alice and Bob play a game. Alice has got n treasure chests (the i-th of which contains a_i coins) and m keys (the j-th of which she can sell Bob for b_j coins).Firstly, Alice puts some locks on the chests. There are m types of locks, the locks of the j-th type can only be opened with the j-th key. To put a lock of type j on the i-th chest, Alice has to pay c_{i,j} dollars. Alice can put any number of different types of locks on each chest (possibly, zero).Then, Bob buys some of the keys from Alice (possibly none, possibly all of them) and opens each chest he can (he can open a chest if he has the keys for all of the locks on this chest). Bob's profit is the difference between the total number of coins in the opened chests and the total number of coins he spends buying keys from Alice. If Bob's profit is  (greater than zero), he wins the game. Otherwise, Alice wins the game.Alice wants to put some locks on some chests so no matter which keys Bob buys, she always wins (Bob cannot get positive profit). Of course, she wants to spend the minimum possible number of dollars on buying the locks. Help her to determine whether she can win the game at all, and if she can, how many dollars she has to spend on the locks.
1197	Do Not Be Distracted! Polycarp has 26 tasks. Each task is designated by a capital letter of the Latin alphabet.The teacher asked Polycarp to solve tasks in the following way: if Polycarp began to solve some task, then he must solve it to the end, without being distracted by another task. After switching to another task, Polycarp cannot return to the previous task.Polycarp can only solve one task during the day. Every day he wrote down what task he solved. Now the teacher wants to know if Polycarp followed his advice.For example, if Polycarp solved tasks in the following order: "", then the teacher will see that on the third day Polycarp began to solve the task '', then on the fifth day he got distracted and began to solve the task '', on the eighth day Polycarp returned to the task ''. Other examples of when the teacher is suspicious: "", "" and "".If Polycarp solved the tasks as follows: "", then the teacher cannot have any suspicions. Please note that Polycarp is not obligated to solve all tasks. Other examples of when the teacher doesn't have any suspicious: "", "" and "".Help Polycarp find out if his teacher might be suspicious.
1198	Ordinary Numbers Let's call a positive integer n ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1, 2 and 99 are ordinary numbers, but 719 and 2021 are not ordinary numbers.For a given number n, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1 to n.
1199	Not Adjacent Matrix We will consider the numbers a and b as adjacent if they differ by exactly one, that is, |a-b|=1.We will consider cells of a square matrix n \times n as adjacent if they have a common side, that is, for cell (r, c) cells (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r-1, c) and (r+1, c) are adjacent to it.For a given number n, construct a square matrix n \times n such that: 
1200	Same Differences You are given an array a of n integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a_j - a_i = j - i.
1201	Arranging The Sheep You are playing the game "Arranging The Sheep". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '' (empty space) and '' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square . The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string "", then the following game scenario is possible: For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.
1202	Nastia and Nearly Good Numbers Nastia has 2 positive integers A and B. She defines that:For example, if A = 6 and B = 4, the integers 24 and 72 are good, the integers 6, 660 and 12 are nearly good, the integers 16, 7 are neither good nor nearly good.Find 3  positive integers x, y, and z such that  of them is good and the  2 are nearly good, and x + y = z.
1203	Nastia and a Good Array .She calls such an array a good that for all i (2 \le i \le n) takes place gcd(a_{i - 1}, a_{i}) = 1, where gcd(u, v) denotes the  of integers u and v.You can perform the operation: select two  indices i, j (1 \le i, j \le n, i \neq j) and two integers x, y (1 \le x, y \le 2 \cdot 10^9) so that \min{(a_i, a_j)} = \min{(x, y)}. Then change a_i to x and a_j to y.The girl asks you to make the array good using  n operations.It can be proven that this is always possible.
1204	Nastia and a Hidden Permutation Nastia has a hidden permutation p of length n consisting of integers from 1 to n. You, for some reason, want to figure out the permutation. To do that, you can give her an integer t (1 \le t \le 2), two  indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n, i \neq j), and an integer x (1 \le x \le n - 1). Depending on t, she will answer: You can ask Nastia  \lfloor \frac {3 \cdot n} { 2} \rfloor + 30 times. It is guaranteed that she will  change her permutation depending on your queries. Can you guess the permutation?
1205	Nastia Plays with a Tree The girl will perform the following operation with her tree, as long as she needs:What is the  number of operations Nastia needs to get a bamboo from a tree? A bamboo is a tree in which no node has a degree greater than 2.
1206	Nastia and a Beautiful Matrix Let a_i be how many numbers i (1 \le i \le k) you have.An n \times n matrix is called beautiful if it contains  the numbers you have, and for  2 \times 2 submatrix of the original matrix is satisfied: Make a beautiful matrix of  size.
1207	Game of Life William really likes the cellular automaton called "Game of Life" so he decided to make his own version. For simplicity, William decided to define his cellular automaton on an array containing n cells, with each cell either being alive or dead.Evolution of the array in William's cellular automaton occurs iteratively in the following way:Check the note section for examples of the evolution.You are given some initial state of all elements and you need to help William find the state of the array after m iterations of evolution.
1208	Lord of the Values While trading on his favorite exchange trader William realized that he found a vulnerability. Using this vulnerability he could change the values of certain internal variables to his advantage. To play around he decided to change the values of all internal variables from a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n to -a_1, -a_2, \ldots, -a_n. For some unknown reason, the number of service variables is always an even number.William understands that with his every action he attracts more and more attention from the exchange's security team, so the number of his actions must not exceed 5\,000 and after every operation no variable can have an absolute value greater than 10^{18}. William can perform actions of two types for two chosen variables with indices i and j, where i < j:
1209	Compression and Expansion William is a huge fan of planning ahead. That is why he starts his morning routine by creating a nested list of upcoming errands.A valid nested list is any list which can be created from a list with one item "" by applying some operations. Each operation inserts a new item into the list, , just after one of existing items a_1 \,.\, a_2 \,.\, a_3 \,.\, \,\cdots\, \,.\,a_k and can be one of two types: When William decided to save a Word document with the list of his errands he accidentally hit a completely different keyboard shortcut from the "" he wanted to hit. It's not known exactly what shortcut he pressed but after triggering it all items in the list were replaced by a single number: the last number originally written in the item number.William wants you to help him restore a fitting original nested list.
1210	Love-Hate William is hosting a party for n of his trader friends. They started a discussion on various currencies they trade, but there's an issue: not all of his trader friends like every currency. They like some currencies, but not others.For each William's friend i it is known whether he likes currency j. There are m currencies in total. It is also known that a trader may not like more than p currencies.Because friends need to have some common topic for discussions they need to find the largest by cardinality (possibly empty) subset of currencies, such that there are at least \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil friends (rounded up) who like each currency in this subset.
1211	Crypto Lights To monitor cryptocurrency exchange rates trader William invented a wonderful device consisting of n lights arranged in a row. The device functions in the following way:Initially, all lights on William's device are turned off. At the beginning of a new iteration the device randomly, with a uniform distribution, picks a light that is turned off and turns it on, telling William which cryptocurrency he should invest in. After this iteration if any k consecutive lights contain more than one turned on light, then the device finishes working.William doesn't like uncertainty, so he wants you to calculate the expected value of the number of lights that are turned on in the device after it finishes working.
1212	Favorite Game After William is done with work for the day, he enjoys playing his favorite video game.The game happens in a 2D world, starting at turn 0. William can pick any cell in the game world and spawn in it. Then, each turn, William may remain at his current location or move from the current location (x, y) to one of the following locations: (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1).To accelerate movement the game has n fast travel towers. i-th tower is located at location (xa_i, ya_i). To be able to instantly travel to the tower from any location in the game world it must first be activated. Activation of tower i happens at the moment when the player is in cell (xa_i, ya_i) after this the tower remains active throughout the entire game.William also knows that the game has m quests. i-th quest can be completed instantly by being at location (xb_i, yb_i) on turn t_i.William wants to find out the maximal number of quests he will be able to complete by optimally traversing the game world.
1213	Potion-making You have an initially empty cauldron, and you want to brew a potion in it. The potion consists of two ingredients: magic essence and water. The potion you want to brew should contain exactly k\ \% magic essence and (100 - k)\ \% water.In one step, you can pour either one liter of magic essence or one liter of water into the cauldron. What is the minimum number of steps to brew a potion? You don't care about the total volume of the potion, only about the ratio between magic essence and water in it.A small reminder: if you pour e liters of essence and w liters of water (e + w > 0) into the cauldron, then it contains \frac{e}{e + w} \cdot 100\ \% (without rounding) magic essence and \frac{w}{e + w} \cdot 100\ \% water.
1214	Permutation Sort You are given a permutation a consisting of n numbers 1, 2, ..., n (a permutation is an array in which each element from 1 to n occurs exactly once).You can perform the following operation: choose some subarray (contiguous subsegment) of a and rearrange the elements in it in any way you want. But this operation cannot be applied to the whole array.For example, if a = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3] and we want to apply the operation to the subarray a[2, 4] (the subarray containing all elements from the 2-nd to the 4-th), then after the operation, the array can become a = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3] or, for example, a = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3].Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation a in ascending order.
1215	Robot Collisions There are n robots driving along an OX axis. There are also two walls: one is at coordinate 0 and one is at coordinate m.The i-th robot starts at an integer coordinate x_i~(0 < x_i < m) and moves either left (towards the 0) or right with the speed of 1 unit per second. No two robots start at the same coordinate.Whenever a robot reaches a wall, it turns around instantly and continues his ride in the opposite direction with the same speed.Whenever several robots meet at the same  coordinate, they collide and explode into dust. Once a robot has exploded, it doesn't collide with any other robot. Note that if several robots meet at a non-integer coordinate, nothing happens.For each robot find out if it ever explodes and print the time of explosion if it happens and -1 otherwise.
1216	Armchairs There are n armchairs, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Some armchairs are occupied by people (at most one person per armchair), others are not. The number of occupied armchairs is not greater than \frac{n}{2}.For some reason, you would like to tell people to move from their armchairs to some other ones. If the i-th armchair is occupied by someone and the j-th armchair is not, you can tell the person sitting in the i-th armchair to move to the j-th armchair. The time it takes a person to move from the i-th armchair to the j-th one is |i - j| minutes. You may perform this operation any number of times, but these operations must be done sequentially, i. e. you cannot tell a person to move until the person you asked to move in the last operation has finished moving to their destination armchair.You want to achieve the following situation: every seat that was initially occupied must be free. What is the minimum time you need to do it?
1217	Assimilation IV Monocarp is playing a game "Assimilation IV". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.Monocarp's empire has n cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build . The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.Monocarp has m points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most 1 to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most 2, the turn after — at distance at most 3, and so on. Monocarp will build n Monuments in n turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among m of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number n. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!
1218	Goblins And Gnomes Monocarp plays a computer game called "Goblins and Gnomes". In this game, he manages a large underground city of gnomes and defends it from hordes of goblins.The city consists of n halls and m one-directional tunnels connecting them. The structure of tunnels has the following property: if a goblin leaves any hall, he cannot return to that hall. The city will be attacked by k waves of goblins; during the i-th wave, i goblins attack the city. Monocarp's goal is to pass all k waves.The i-th wave goes as follows: firstly, i goblins appear in some halls of the city and pillage them; . Then, goblins start moving along the tunnels, pillaging all the halls in their path. Goblins are very greedy and cunning, so they choose their paths so that no two goblins pass through the same hall. Among all possible attack plans, they choose a plan which allows them to . After goblins are done pillaging, they leave the city.If all halls are pillaged during the wave — Monocarp loses the game. Otherwise, the city is restored. If some hall is pillaged during a wave, goblins are still interested in pillaging it during the next waves.Before each wave, Monocarp can spend some time preparing to it. Monocarp doesn't have any strict time limits on his preparations (he decides when to call each wave by himself), but the longer he prepares for a wave, the fewer points he gets for passing it. If Monocarp prepares for the i-th wave for t_i minutes, then he gets \max(0, x_i - t_i \cdot y_i) points for passing it (obviously, if he doesn't lose in the process).While preparing for a wave, Monocarp can block tunnels. He can spend one minute to . If Monocarp blocks a tunnel while preparing for a wave, it stays blocked during the next waves as well.Help Monocarp to defend against all k waves of goblins and get the maximum possible amount of points!
1219	Mean Inequality You are given an array a of 2n  integers. You want to arrange the elements of the array in a circle such that no element is equal to the the arithmetic mean of its 2 neighbours.More formally, find an array b, such that: b is a permutation of a.For every i from 1 to 2n, b_i \neq \frac{b_{i-1}+b_{i+1}}{2}, where b_0 = b_{2n} and b_{2n+1} = b_1.It can be proved that under the constraints of this problem, such array b always exists.
1220	I Hate 1111 You are given an integer x. Can you make x by summing up some number of 11, 111, 1111, 11111, \ldots? (You can use any number among them any number of times).For instance, 
1221	Kill Anton After rejecting 10^{100} data structure problems, Errorgorn is very angry at Anton and decided to kill him.Anton's DNA can be represented as a string a which only contains the characters "" (there are only 4 distinct characters). Errorgorn can change Anton's DNA into string b which must be a  of a. However, Anton's body can defend against this attack. In 1 second, his body can swap 2  characters of his DNA to transform it back to a. Anton's body is smart and will use the minimum number of moves.To maximize the chance of Anton dying, Errorgorn wants to change Anton's DNA the string that maximizes the time for Anton's body to revert his DNA. But since Errorgorn is busy making more data structure problems, he needs your help to find the best string B. Can you help him?
1222	Oolimry and Suffix Array Once upon a time, Oolimry saw a suffix array. He wondered how many strings can produce this suffix array. More formally, given a suffix array of length n and having an alphabet size k, count the number of strings that produce such a suffix array. Let s be a string of length n. Then the i-th suffix of s is the substring s[i \ldots n-1]. A suffix array is the array of integers that represent the starting indexes of all the suffixes of a given string, after the suffixes are sorted in the lexicographic order. For example, the suffix array of  is [3,2,4,1,0,5,6] as the array of sorted suffixes is [\texttt{imry},\texttt{limry},\texttt{mry},\texttt{olimry},\texttt{oolimry},\texttt{ry},\texttt{y}]. A string x is lexicographically smaller than string y, if either x is a prefix of y (and x\neq y), or there exists such i that x_i < y_i, and for any 1\leq j < i , x_j = y_j.
1223	Median Queries There is a secret permutation p (1-indexed) of numbers from 1 to n. More formally, for 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq p[i] \leq n and for 1 \leq i < j \leq n, p[i] \neq p[j]. .In 1 query, you give 3  integers a,b,c (1 \leq a,b,c \leq n), and receive the  of \{|p[a]-p[b]|,|p[b]-p[c]|,|p[a]-p[c]|\}.In this case, the median is the 2-nd element (1-indexed) of the sequence when sorted in non-decreasing order. The median of \{4,6,2\} is 4 and the median of \{0,123,33\} is 33.Can you find the secret permutation in not more than 2n+420 queries? the permutation is fixed before any queries are made.
1224	And Then There Were K Given an integer n, find the maximum value of integer k such that the following condition holds: 
1225	Sequence Pair Weight The  of a sequence is defined as the number of unordered pairs of indexes (i,j) (here i \lt j) with same value (a_{i} = a_{j}). For example, the weight of sequence a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] is 4. The set of unordered pairs of indexes with same value are (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 4).You are given a sequence a of n integers. Print the sum of the weight of all subsegments of a. A sequence b is a subsegment of a sequence a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
1226	MEX Tree You are given a tree with n nodes, numerated from 0 to n-1. For each k between 0 and n, inclusive, you have to count the number of unordered pairs (u,v), u \neq v, such that the  of all the node labels in the shortest path from u to v (including end points) is k.The  of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence.
1227	Partition Game You are given an array a of n integers. Define the cost of some array t as follows:cost(t) = \sum_{x \in set(t) } last(x) - first(x), where set(t) is the set of all values in t without repetitions, first(x), and last(x) are the indices of the first and last occurrence of x in t, respectively. In other words, we compute the distance between the first and last occurrences for each distinct element and sum them up.You need to split the array a into k consecutive segments such that each element of a belongs to exactly one segment and the sum of the cost of individual segments is minimum.
1228	Parsa's Humongous Tree Parsa has a humongous tree on n vertices.On each vertex v he has written two integers l_v and r_v.To make Parsa's tree look even more majestic, Nima wants to assign a number a_v (l_v \le a_v \le r_v) to each vertex v such that the beauty of Parsa's tree is maximized.Nima's sense of the beauty is rather bizarre. He defines the beauty of the tree as the sum of |a_u - a_v| over all edges (u, v) of the tree.Since Parsa's tree is too large, Nima can't maximize its beauty on his own. Your task is to find the  possible beauty for Parsa's tree.
1229	Kavi on Pairing Duty Kavi has 2n points lying on the OX axis, i-th of which is located at x = i.Kavi considers all ways to split these 2n points into n pairs. Among those, he is interested in  pairings, which are defined as follows:Consider n segments with ends at the points in correspondent pairs. The pairing is called good, if for every 2 different segments A and B among those, at least one of the following holds:Consider the following example:A is a good pairing since the red segment lies completely inside the blue segment.B is a good pairing since the red and the blue segment have the same length.C is not a good pairing since none of the red or blue segments lies inside the other, neither do they have the same size.Kavi is interested in the number of good pairings, so he wants you to find it for him. As the result can be large, find this number modulo 998244353.Two pairings are called different, if some two points are in one pair in some pairing and in different pairs in another.
1230	Trees of Tranquillity Soroush and Keshi each have a labeled and rooted tree on n vertices. Both of their trees are rooted from vertex 1.Soroush and Keshi used to be at war. After endless decades of fighting, they finally became allies to prepare a Codeforces round. To celebrate this fortunate event, they decided to make a memorial graph on n vertices.They add an edge between vertices u and v in the memorial graph if  of the following conditions hold: Here vertex u is considered ancestor of vertex v, if u lies on the path from 1 (the root) to the v.Popping out of nowhere, Mashtali tried to find the maximum clique in the memorial graph for no reason. He failed because the graph was too big. Help Mashtali by finding the size of the maximum clique in the memorial graph.As a reminder, clique is a subset of vertices of the graph, each two of which are connected by an edge.
1231	It's a bird! No, it's a plane! No, it's AaParsa! There are n cities in Shaazzzland, numbered from 0 to n-1. Ghaazzzland, the immortal enemy of Shaazzzland, is ruled by AaParsa.As the head of the Ghaazzzland's intelligence agency, AaParsa is carrying out the most important spying mission in Ghaazzzland's history on Shaazzzland.AaParsa has planted m transport cannons in the cities of Shaazzzland. The i-th cannon is planted in the city a_i and is initially pointing at city b_i.It is guaranteed that each of the n cities has  transport cannon planted inside it, and that no two cannons from the same city are initially pointing at the same city (that is, all pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct).AaParsa used very advanced technology to build the cannons, the cannons rotate every second. In other words, if the i-th cannon is pointing towards the city x at some second, it will target the city (x + 1) \mod n at the next second.As their name suggests, transport cannons are for transportation, specifically for human transport. If you use the i-th cannon to launch yourself towards the city that it's currently pointing at, you'll be airborne for c_i seconds before reaching your target destination.If you still don't get it, using the i-th cannon at the s-th second (using which is only possible if you are currently in the city a_i) will shoot you to the city (b_i + s) \mod n and you'll land in there after c_i seconds (so you'll be there in the (s + c_i)-th second). Also note the cannon that you initially launched from will rotate every second but you obviously won't change direction while you are airborne. AaParsa wants to use the cannons for travelling between Shaazzzland's cities in his grand plan, and he can start travelling at second 0. For him to fully utilize them, he needs to know the minimum number of seconds required to reach city u from city v using the cannons for every pair of cities (u, v)..
1232	Mashtali and Hagh Trees Today is Mashtali's birthday! He received a  tree from Haj Davood as his birthday present!A directed tree is called a  tree iff: After opening his gift, Mashtali found out that the labels on the vertices were gone.Immediately, he asked himself: how many different unlabeled Hagh trees are there? That is, how many possible trees could he have received as his birthday present?At the first glance, the number of such trees seemed to be infinite since there was no limit on the number of vertices; but then he solved the problem and proved that Amazed by this fact, he shared the task with you so that you could enjoy solving it as well. Since the answer can be rather large he asked you to find the number of different unlabeled Hagh trees modulo 998244353.Here two trees are considered different, if they are not isomorphic: if there is no way to map nodes of one tree to the second tree, so that edges are mapped to edges preserving the orientation.Some examples for n = 2: Directed trees D and E are Hagh. C is not Hagh because it has a vertex with 4 edges attached to it. A and B are not Hagh because their longest directed paths are not equal to n. Also in B the leftmost and rightmost vertices are not friends neither do they have a mutual friend.
1233	AmShZ Farm To AmShZ, all arrays are equal, but some arrays are  than others. Specifically, the arrays consisting of n elements from 1 to n that can be turned into permutations of numbers from 1 to n by adding a non-negative integer to each element.Mashtali  thinks that an array b consisting of k elements is compatible with a  array a consisting of n elements if for each 1 \le i \le k we have 1 \le b_i \le n and also a_{b_1} = a_{b_2} = \ldots = a_{b_k}.Find the number of pairs of arrays a and b such that a is a more-equal array consisting of n elements and b is an array compatible with a consisting of k elements modulo 998244353.Note that the elements of b are , same holds for a.
1234	Eshag Loves Big Arrays Eshag has an array a consisting of n integers.Eshag can perform the following operation any number of times: choose some subsequence of a and delete every element from it which is  larger than AVG, where AVG is the average of the numbers in the chosen subsequence.For example, if a = [1 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 4] and Eshag applies the operation to the subsequence containing a_1, a_2, a_4 and a_5, then he will delete those of these 4 elements which are larger than \frac{a_1+a_2+a_4+a_5}{4} = \frac{11}{4}, so after the operation, the array a will become a = [1 , 3 , 2].Your task is to find the  number of elements Eshag can delete from the array a by applying the operation described above some number (maybe, zero) times.A sequence b is a subsequence of an array c if b can be obtained from c by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
1235	Sifid and Strange Subsequences A sequence (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k) is called , if the absolute difference between any pair of its elements is greater than or equal to the maximum element in the sequence. Formally speaking, it's strange if for every pair (i, j) with 1 \le i<j \le k, we have |a_i-a_j|\geq MAX, where MAX is the largest element of the sequence. In particular, any sequence of length at most 1 is strange.For example, the sequences (-2021, -1, -1, -1) and (-1, 0, 1) are strange, but (3, 0, 1) is not, because |0 - 1| < 3.Sifid has an array a of n integers. Sifid likes everything big, so among all the strange subsequences of a, he wants to find the length of the  one. Can you help him?A sequence c is a subsequence of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
1236	Binary Decimal Let's call a number a  if it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1\,010\,111 is a binary decimal, while 10\,201 and 787\,788 are not.Given a number n, you are asked to represent n as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.
1237	Putting Plates To celebrate your birthday you have prepared a festive table! Now you want to seat as many guests as possible.The table can be represented as a rectangle with height h and width w, divided into h \times w cells. Let (i, j) denote the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column of the rectangle (1 \le i \le h; 1 \le j \le w).Into each cell of the table you can either put a plate or keep it empty.As each guest has to be seated next to their plate, you can only put plates on the edge of the table — into the first or the last row of the rectangle, or into the first or the last column. Formally, for each cell (i, j) you put a plate into, at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied: i = 1, i = h, j = 1, j = w.To make the guests comfortable, no two plates must be put into cells that have a common side or corner. In other words, if cell (i, j) contains a plate, you can't put plates into cells (i - 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i - 1, j - 1), (i - 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j + 1).Put as many plates on the table as possible without violating the rules above.
1238	Pursuit You and your friend Ilya are participating in an individual programming contest consisting of multiple stages. A contestant can get between 0 and 100 points, inclusive, for each stage, independently of other contestants.Points received by contestants in different stages are used for forming overall contest results. Suppose that k stages of the contest are completed. For each contestant, k - \lfloor \frac{k}{4} \rfloor stages with the highest scores are selected, and these scores are added up. This sum is the overall result of the contestant. (Here \lfloor t \rfloor denotes rounding t down.)For example, suppose 9 stages are completed, and your scores are 50, 30, 50, 50, 100, 10, 30, 100, 50. First, 7 stages with the highest scores are chosen — for example, all stages except for the 2-nd and the 6-th can be chosen. Then your overall result is equal to 50 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 30 + 100 + 50 = 430.As of now, n stages are completed, and you know the points you and Ilya got for these stages. However, it is unknown how many more stages will be held. You wonder what the smallest number of additional stages is, after which your result might become greater than or equal to Ilya's result, at least in theory. Find this number!
1239	Secret Santa Every December, VK traditionally holds an event for its employees named "Secret Santa". Here's how it happens.n employees numbered from 1 to n take part in the event. Each employee i is assigned a different employee b_i, to which employee i has to make a new year gift. Each employee is assigned to exactly one other employee, and nobody is assigned to themselves (but two employees may be assigned to each other). Formally, all b_i must be distinct integers between 1 and n, and for any i, b_i \ne i must hold.The assignment is usually generated randomly. This year, as an experiment, all event participants have been asked who they wish to make a gift to. Each employee i has said that they wish to make a gift to employee a_i.Find a valid assignment b that maximizes the number of fulfilled wishes of the employees.
1240	Minimax  of string t = t_1 t_2 \ldots t_n and position i in it is defined as the length k of the longest proper (not equal to the whole substring) prefix of substring t_1 t_2 \ldots t_i which is also a suffix of the same substring.For example, for string t =   the values of the prefix function in positions 1, 2, \ldots, 7 are equal to [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3].Let f(t) be equal to the  value of the prefix function of string t over all its positions. For example, f() = 3.You are given a string s. Reorder its characters arbitrarily to get a string t (the number of occurrences of any character in strings s and t must be equal). The value of f(t) must be . Out of all options to minimize f(t), choose the one where string t is the .
1241	Bingo Getting ready for VK Fest 2021, you prepared a table with n rows and n columns, and filled each cell of this table with some event related with the festival that could either happen or not: for example, whether you will win a prize on the festival, or whether it will rain.Forecasting algorithms used in VK have already estimated the probability for each event to happen. Event in row i and column j will happen with probability a_{i, j} \cdot 10^{-4}. All of the events are mutually independent.Let's call the table  if there exists a line such that all n events on it happen. The line could be any horizontal line (cells (i, 1), (i, 2), \ldots, (i, n) for some i), any vertical line (cells (1, j), (2, j), \ldots, (n, j) for some j), the main diagonal (cells (1, 1), (2, 2), \ldots, (n, n)), or the antidiagonal (cells (1, n), (2, n - 1), \ldots, (n, 1)).Find the probability of your table to be winning, and output it modulo 31\,607 (see Output section).
1242	Frog Jumping A frog is currently at the point 0 on a coordinate axis Ox. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is a units to the right, the second jump is b units to the left, the third jump is a units to the right, the fourth jump is b units to the left, and so on.Formally: Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after k jumps.But... One more thing. You are watching t different frogs so you have to answer t independent queries.
1243	Uniform String You are given two integers n and k.Your task is to construct such a string s of length n that for each i from 1 to k there is at least one i-th letter of the Latin alphabet in this string (the first letter is 'a', the second is 'b' and so on) and there are no other letters except these. You have to  of some letter (the frequency of a letter is the number of occurrences of this letter in a string). If there are several possible answers, you can print .You have to answer t  queries.
1244	Teams Forming There are n students in a university. The number of students is even. The i-th student has programming skill equal to a_i. The coach wants to form \frac{n}{2} teams. Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal (otherwise they cannot understand each other and cannot form a team).Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.The coach wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly \frac{n}{2} teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to find this number.
1245	Good Array Let's call an array  if there is an element in the array that equals to the sum of all other elements. For example, the array a=[1, 3, 3, 7] is good because there is the element a_4=7 which equals to the sum 1 + 3 + 3.You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Your task is to print all indices j of this array such that after removing the j-th element from the array it will be  (let's call such indices ).For example, if a=[8, 3, 5, 2], the  indices are 1 and 4: You have to consider all removals , i. e. remove the element, check if the resulting array is , and return the element into the array.
1246	Prefixes and Suffixes Ivan wants to play a game with you. He picked some string s of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from 1 to n-1), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!
1247	Colour the Flag Today we will be playing a red and white colouring game (no, this is not the Russian Civil War; these are just the colours of the Canadian flag).You are given an n \times m grid of "", "", and "" characters. "" is red, "" is white and "" is blank. The neighbours of a cell are those that share an edge with it (those that only share a corner do not count).Your job is to colour the blank cells red or white so that every red cell only has white neighbours (and no red ones) and every white cell only has red neighbours (and no white ones). You are not allowed to recolour already coloured cells.
1248	Histogram Ugliness Little Dormi received a histogram with n bars of height a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n for Christmas. However, the more he played with his new histogram, the more he realized its imperfections, so today he wanted to modify it to his liking.To modify the histogram, Little Dormi is able to perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times:Little Dormi defines the ugliness score of his histogram (after performing some number of operations) as the sum of the vertical length of its outline and the number of operations he performed on it. And to make the histogram as perfect as possible, he would like to minimize the ugliness score after modifying it with some number of operations.However, as his histogram is very large, Little Dormi is having trouble minimizing the ugliness score, so as Little Dormi's older brother, help him find the minimal ugliness.Consider the following example where the histogram has 4 columns of heights 4,8,9,6:The blue region represents the histogram, and the red lines represent the vertical portion of the outline. Currently, the vertical length of the outline is 4+4+1+3+6 = 18, so if Little Dormi does not modify the histogram at all, the ugliness would be 18.However, Little Dormi can apply the operation once on column 2 and twice on column 3, resulting in a histogram with heights 4,7,7,6:Now, as the total vertical length of the outline (red lines) is 4+3+1+6=14, the ugliness is 14+3=17 dollars. It can be proven that this is optimal.
1249	Little Alawn's Puzzle When he's not training for IOI, Little Alawn enjoys playing with puzzles of various types to stimulate his brain. Today, he's playing with a puzzle that consists of a 2 \times n grid where each row is a permutation of the numbers 1,2,3,\ldots,n.The goal of Little Alawn's puzzle is to make sure no numbers on the same column or row are the same (we'll call this state of the puzzle as solved), and to achieve this he is able to swap the numbers in any column. However, after solving the puzzle many times, Little Alawn got bored and began wondering about the number of possible solved configurations of the puzzle he could achieve from an initial  configuration only by swapping numbers in a column.Unfortunately, Little Alawn got stuck while trying to solve this harder problem, so he was wondering if you could help him with it. Find the answer modulo 10^9+7.
1250	Lost Tree .Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of n nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n.The game master only allows him to ask one type of question:Additionally, to  challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most \lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil questions, where \lceil x \rceil denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.
1251	Lost Array Note: the XOR-sum of an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) is defined as a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_n, where \oplus denotes the .Little Dormi received an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n for Christmas. However, while playing with it over the winter break, he accidentally dropped it into his XOR machine, and the array got lost.The XOR machine is currently configured with a query size of k (which you cannot change), and allows you to perform the following type of query: by giving the machine k  indices x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k, it will output a_{x_1} \oplus a_{x_2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{x_k}.As Little Dormi's older brother, you would like to help him recover the  of his array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n by querying the XOR machine.Little Dormi isn't very patient, so to be as fast as possible, you must query the XOR machine the  number of times to find the XOR-sum of his array. Formally, let d be the minimum number of queries needed to find the XOR-sum of any array of length n with a query size of k. Your program will be accepted if you find the correct XOR-sum in at most d queries.Lastly, you also noticed that with certain configurations of the machine k and values of n, it may not be possible to recover the XOR-sum of Little Dormi's lost array. If that is the case, you should report it as well.The array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n is fixed before you start querying the XOR machine and does not change with the queries.
1252	Fair Playoff Four players participate in the playoff tournament. The tournament is held according to the following scheme: the first player will play with the second, and the third player with the fourth, then the winners of the pairs will play in the finals of the tournament.It is known that in a match between two players, the one whose skill is greater will win. The skill of the i-th player is equal to s_i and all skill levels are pairwise different (i. e. there are no two identical values in the array s).The tournament is called  if the two players with the highest skills meet in the finals.Determine whether the given tournament is .
1253	Array Reodering You are given an array a consisting of n integers.Let's call a pair of indices i, j  if 1 \le i < j \le n and \gcd(a_i, 2a_j) > 1 (where \gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y).Find the maximum number of  index pairs if you can reorder the array a in an arbitrary way.
1254	Unstable String You are given a string s consisting of the characters , , and .Let's call a string  if it consists of the characters  and  and any two adjacent characters are different (i. e. it has the form  or ).Let's call a string  if it consists of the characters , , and , and you can replace the characters  to  or  (for each character, the choice is independent), so that the string becomes .For example, the strings , , and  are beautiful, and the strings  and  are not.Calculate the number of beautiful contiguous substrings of the string s.
1255	Playoff Tournament 2^k teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of 2^k - 1 games. They are held as follows: first of all, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4 (exactly in this order), and so on (so, 2^{k-1} games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only 2^{k-1} teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, 2^{k-2} games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "1 vs 2" plays against the winner of the game "3 vs 4", then the winner of the game "5 vs 6" plays against the winner of the game "7 vs 8", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.For example, this picture describes the chronological order of games with k = 3:Let the string s consisting of 2^k - 1 characters describe the results of the games in chronological order as follows:Let f(s) be the number of  of the tournament described by the string s. A team i is a  of the tournament if it is possible to replace every  with either  or  in such a way that team i is the champion.You are given the initial state of the string s. You have to process q queries of the following form: 
1256	Gold Transfer You are given a rooted tree. Each vertex contains a_i tons of gold, which costs c_i per one ton. Initially, the tree consists only a root numbered 0 with a_0 tons of gold and price c_0 per ton.There are q queries. Each query has one of two types: If we buy x tons of gold in some vertex v the remaining amount of gold in it decreases by x (of course, we can't buy more gold that vertex has at the moment). For each query of the second type, calculate the resulting amount of gold we bought and the amount of money we should spend.Note that you should solve the problem in  mode. It means that you can't read the whole input at once. You can read each query only after writing the answer for the last query, so don't forget to flush output after printing answers. You can use functions like  in  and  in  or similar after each writing in your program. In standard (if you don't tweak I/O),  flushes  in  and  in  (or  in ) makes automatic flush as well. 
1257	String Distance Suppose you are given two strings a and b. You can apply the following operation any number of times: choose any  substring of a or b, and sort the characters in it in non-descending order. Let f(a, b) the minimum number of operations you have to apply in order to make them equal (or f(a, b) = 1337 if it is impossible to make a and b equal using these operations).For example: You are given n strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k having equal length. Calculate \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{n} \sum\limits_{j = i + 1}^{n} f(s_i, s_j).
1258	Omkar and Bad Story Omkar has received a message from Anton saying "Your story for problem A is confusing. Just make a formal statement." Because of this, Omkar gives you an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of n distinct integers. An array b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k] is called  if for any two distinct elements b_i, b_j of b, |b_i-b_j| appears in b at least once. In addition, all elements in b must be distinct. Can you add several (maybe, 0) integers to a to create a  array b ? If a is already , you don't have to add any elements.For example, array [3, 6, 9] is , as |6-3|=|9-6| = 3, which appears in the array, and |9-3| = 6, which appears in the array, while array [4, 2, 0, 6, 9] is not , as |9-4| = 5 is not present in the array.For integers x and y, |x-y| = x-y if x > y and |x-y| = y-x otherwise.
1259	Prinzessin der Verurteilung  It is no surprise Fischl speaks with a strange choice of words. However, this time, not even Oz, her raven friend, can interpret her expressions! Maybe you can help us understand what this young princess is saying?You are given a string of n lowercase Latin letters, the word that Fischl just spoke. You think that the MEX of this string may help you find the meaning behind this message. The MEX of the string is defined as the shortest string that  appear as a contiguous substring in the input. If multiple strings exist, the lexicographically smallest one is considered the MEX. Note that the empty substring does NOT count as a valid MEX.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.Find out what the MEX of the string is!
1260	Diluc and Kaeya This time, the brothers are dealing with a strange piece of wood marked with their names. This plank of wood can be represented as a string of n characters. Each character is either a  or a . You want to make some number of cuts (possibly 0) on this string, partitioning it into several contiguous pieces, each with length at least 1. Both brothers act with dignity, so they want to split the wood as evenly as possible. They want to know the maximum number of pieces you can split the wood into such that the ratios of the number of occurrences of  to the number of occurrences of  in each chunk are the same.Kaeya, the curious thinker, is interested in the solution for multiple scenarios. He wants to know the answer for every  of the given string. Help him to solve this problem!For a string we define a ratio as a:b where  appears in it a times, and  appears b times. Note that a or b can equal 0, but not both. Ratios a:b and c:d are considered equal if and only if a\cdot d = b\cdot c. For example, for the string  the ratio will be 3:0, for  — 2:1, for  — 1:2, and for  — 2:4. Note that the ratios of the latter two strings are equal to each other, but they are not equal to the ratios of the first two strings.
1261	Omkar and Medians Uh oh! Ray lost his array yet again! However, Omkar might be able to help because he thinks he has found the  of Ray's array. The  of an array a with elements a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2k-1}, is the array b with elements b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{k} such that b_i is equal to the median of a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2i-1} for all i. Omkar has found an array b of size n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, -10^9 \leq b_i \leq 10^9). Given this array b, Ray wants to test Omkar's claim and see if b actually is an  of some array a. Can you help Ray?The median of a set of numbers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2i-1} is the number c_{i} where c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{2i-1} represents a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2i-1} sorted in nondecreasing order. 
1262	Omkar and Forest Omkar's most recent follower, Ajit, has entered the Holy Forest. Ajit realizes that Omkar's forest is an n by m grid (1 \leq n, m \leq 2000) of some non-negative integers. Since the forest is blessed by Omkar, it satisfies some special conditions:Unfortunately, Ajit is not fully worthy of Omkar's powers yet. He sees each cell as a "0" or a "#". If a cell is labeled as "0", then the number in it must equal 0. Otherwise, the number in it can be any nonnegative integer.Determine how many different assignments of elements exist such that these special conditions are satisfied. Two assignments are considered different if there exists at least one cell such that the numbers written in it in these assignments are different. Since the answer may be enormous, find the answer modulo 10^9+7.
1263	Omkar and Akmar Omkar and Akmar are playing a game on a circular board with n (2 \leq n \leq 10^6) cells. The cells are numbered from 1 to n so that for each i (1 \leq i \leq n-1) cell i is adjacent to cell i+1 and cell 1 is adjacent to cell n. Initially, each cell is empty.Omkar and Akmar take turns placing either an A or a B on the board, with Akmar going first. The letter must be placed on an empty cell. In addition, the letter cannot be placed adjacent to a cell containing the same letter. A player loses when it is their turn and there are no more valid moves.Output the number of possible distinct games where both players play optimally modulo 10^9+7. Note that we only consider games where some player has lost and there are no more valid moves.Two games are considered distinct if the number of turns is different or for some turn, the letter or cell number that the letter is placed on were different.A move is considered optimal if the move maximizes the player's chance of winning, assuming the other player plays optimally as well. More formally, if the player who has to move has a winning strategy, they have to make a move after which they will still have a winning strategy. If they do not, they can make any move.
1264	Arithmetic Array An array b of length k is called good if its arithmetic mean is equal to 1. More formally, if \frac{b_1 + \cdots + b_k}{k}=1.Note that the value \frac{b_1+\cdots+b_k}{k} is not rounded up or down. For example, the array [1,1,1,2] has an arithmetic mean of 1.25, which is not equal to 1.You are given an integer array a of length n. In an operation, you can append a  integer to the end of the array. What's the minimum number of operations required to make the array good?We have a proof that it is always possible with finitely many operations.
1265	Bad Boy Riley is a very bad boy, but at the same time, he is a yo-yo master. So, he decided to use his yo-yo skills to annoy his friend Anton.Anton's room can be represented as a grid with n rows and m columns. Let (i, j) denote the cell in row i and column j. Anton is currently standing at position (i, j) in his room. To annoy Anton, Riley decided to throw exactly  yo-yos in cells of the room (they can be in the same cell).Because Anton doesn't like yo-yos thrown on the floor, he has to pick up both of them and return back to the initial position. The distance travelled by Anton is the shortest path that goes through the positions of both yo-yos and returns back to (i, j) by travelling only to adjacent by side cells. That is, if he is in cell (x, y) then he can travel to the cells (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1) and (x, y - 1) in one step (if a cell with those coordinates exists).Riley is wondering where he should throw these two yo-yos so that the distance travelled by Anton is . But because he is very busy, he asked you to tell him.
1266	Challenging Cliffs You are a game designer and want to make an obstacle course. The player will walk from left to right. You have n heights of mountains already selected and want to arrange them so that the absolute difference of the heights of the first and last mountains is as small as possible. In addition, you want to make the game difficult, and since walking uphill or flat is harder than walking downhill, the difficulty of the level will be the number of mountains i (1 \leq i < n) such that h_i \leq h_{i+1} where h_i is the height of the i-th mountain. You don't want to waste any of the mountains you modelled, so you have to use all of them. From all the arrangements that minimize |h_1-h_n|, find one that is the most difficult. If there are multiple orders that satisfy these requirements, you may find any.
1267	Deleting Divisors Alice and Bob are playing a game. They start with a positive integer n and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from n one of its divisors that isn't 1 or n. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.Note that they subtract a divisor of the  number in each turn.You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.
1268	Figure Fixing You have a connected undirected graph made of n nodes and m edges. The i-th node has a value v_i and a target value t_i.In an operation, you can choose an edge (i, j) and add k to both v_i and v_j, where k can be any . In particular, k can be negative.Your task to determine if it is possible that by doing some finite number of operations (possibly zero), you can achieve for every node i, v_i = t_i.
1269	Stone Game Polycarp is playing a new computer game. This game has n stones in a row. The stone on the position i has integer power a_i. .Each turn Polycarp can destroy either stone on the first position or stone on the last position (in other words, either the leftmost or the rightmost stone). When Polycarp destroys the stone it does not exist any more.Now, Polycarp wants two achievements. He gets them if he destroys the stone with the  power and the stone with the  power. Help Polycarp find out what is the minimum number of moves he should make in order to achieve his goal.For example, if n = 5 and a = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2], then Polycarp could make the following moves: Please note that in the example above, you can complete the game in two steps. For example: 
1270	Friends and Candies Polycarp has n friends, the i-th of his friends has a_i candies. Polycarp's friends do not like when they have different numbers of candies. In other words they want all a_i to be the same. To solve this, Polycarp performs the following set of actions exactly : Note that the number k is not fixed in advance and can be arbitrary. Your task is to find the minimum value of k.For example, if n=4 and a=[4, 5, 2, 5], then Polycarp could make the following distribution of the candies: Note that in this example Polycarp cannot choose k=1 friend so that he can redistribute candies so that in the end all a_i are equal.For the data n and a, determine the  value k. With this value k, Polycarp should be able to select k friends and redistribute their candies so that everyone will end up with the same number of candies.
1271	Number of Pairs You are given an array a of n integers. Find the number of pairs (i, j) (1 \le i < j \le n) where the sum of a_i + a_j is greater than or equal to l and less than or equal to r (that is, l \le a_i + a_j \le r).For example, if n = 3, a = [5, 1, 2], l = 4 and r = 7, then two pairs are suitable: 
1272	Another Problem About Dividing Numbers You are given two integers a and b. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations: Your goal is to make a equal to b using exactly k turns.For example, the numbers a=36 and b=48 can be made equal in 4 moves: For the given numbers a and b, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly k turns.
1273	Funny Substrings Polycarp came up with a new programming language. There are only two types of statements in it: All variable names and strings only consist of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and do not exceed 5 characters.The result of the program is the number of occurrences of string  in the string that was written to the variable in the last statement.Polycarp was very tired while inventing that language. He asks you to implement it. Your task is — for given program statements calculate the number of occurrences of string  in the last assigned variable.
1274	Interesting Function You are given two integers l and r, where l < r. We will add 1 to l until the result is equal to r. Thus, there will be exactly r-l additions performed. For each such addition, let's look at the number of digits that will be changed after it.For example: Changed digits always form a suffix of the result written in the decimal system.Output the total number of changed digits, if you want to get r from l, adding 1 each time.
1275	Contest Start There are n people participating in some contest, they start participating in x minutes intervals. That means the first participant starts at time 0, the second participant starts at time x, the third — at time 2 \cdot x, and so on.Duration of contest is t minutes for each participant, so the first participant finishes the contest at time t, the second — at time t + x, and so on. When a participant finishes the contest, their dissatisfaction equals to the number of participants that started the contest (or starting it now), but haven't yet finished it.Determine the sum of dissatisfaction of all participants.
1276	Love Song Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up q questions about this song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the l-th letter to the r-th letter. Vasya considers a substring made up from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment k times, where k is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring "", then Vasya repeats letter '' once, each of the letters '' twice, letter '" three times, so that the resulting string is "", its length is 10. Vasya is interested about the length of the resulting string.Help Petya find the length of each string obtained by Vasya.
1277	Stable Groups There are n students numerated from 1 to n. The level of the i-th student is a_i. You need to split the students into . A group of students is called , if in the sorted array of their levels no two neighboring elements differ by more than x.For example, if x = 4, then the group with levels [1, 10, 8, 4, 4] is stable (because 4 - 1 \le x, 4 - 4 \le x, 8 - 4 \le x, 10 - 8 \le x), while the group with levels [2, 10, 10, 7] is not stable (7 - 2 = 5 > x).Apart from the n given students, teachers can invite at most k additional students with  levels (at teachers' choice). Find the minimum number of stable groups teachers can form from all students (including the newly invited).For example, if there are two students with levels 1 and 5; x = 2; and k \ge 1, then you can invite a new student with level 3 and put all the students in one stable group.
1278	PriceFixed Lena is the most economical girl in Moscow. So, when her dad asks her to buy some food for a trip to the country, she goes to the best store  — "PriceFixed". Here are some rules of that store:Lena needs to buy n products: she must purchase at least a_i items of the i-th product. Help Lena to calculate the minimum amount of money she needs to spend if she optimally chooses the order of purchasing. Note that if she wants, she can buy more items of some product than needed.
1279	Game with Cards The Alice's computer is broken, so she can't play her favorite card game now. To help Alice, Bob wants to answer n her questions. Initially, Bob holds one card with number 0 in the left hand and one in the right hand. In the i-th question, Alice asks Bob to replace a card in the left or right hand with a card with number k_i (Bob chooses which of two cards he changes, Bob must replace exactly one card).After this action, Alice wants the numbers on the left and right cards to belong to given segments (segments for left and right cards can be different). Formally, let the number on the left card be x, and on the right card be y. Then after the i-th swap the following conditions must be satisfied: a_{l, i} \le x \le b_{l, i}, and a_{r, i} \le y \le b_{r,i}.Please determine if Bob can answer all requests. If it is possible, find a way to do it.
1280	Strange Array Vasya has an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Vasya thinks that all numbers in his array are strange for some reason. To calculate how strange the i-th number is, Vasya created the following algorithm.He chooses a subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r, such that 1 \le l \le i \le r \le n, sort its elements in increasing order in his head (he can arrange equal elements arbitrary). After that he finds the center of the segment. The center of a segment is the element at position (l + r) / 2, if the length of the segment is odd, and at position (l + r + 1) / 2 otherwise. Now Vasya finds the element that was at position i before the sorting, and calculates the distance between its current position and the center of the subsegment (the distance between the elements with indices j and k is |j - k|).The strangeness of the number at position i is the maximum distance among all suitable choices of l and r. Vasya wants to calculate the strangeness of each number in his array. Help him to do it. 
1281	Great Graphs Farmer John has a farm that consists of n pastures connected by one-directional roads. Each road has a weight, representing the time it takes to go from the start to the end of the road. The roads could have negative weight, where the cows go so fast that they go back in time! However, Farmer John guarantees that it is impossible for the cows to get stuck in a time loop, where they can infinitely go back in time by traveling across a sequence of roads. Also, each pair of pastures is connected by at most one road in each direction.Unfortunately, Farmer John lost the map of the farm. All he remembers is an array d, where d_i is the smallest amount of time it took the cows to reach the i-th pasture from pasture 1 using a sequence of roads. The cost of his farm is the sum of the weights of each of the roads, and Farmer John needs to know the  cost of a farm that is consistent with his memory.
1282	Tree Array You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. You generate an array from the tree by marking nodes one by one.Initially, when no nodes are marked, a node is equiprobably chosen and marked from the entire tree. After that, until all nodes are marked, a node is equiprobably chosen and marked from the set of unmarked nodes with at least one edge to a marked node. It can be shown that the process marks all nodes in the tree. The final array a is the list of the nodes' labels in order of the time each node was marked.Find the expected number of inversions in the array that is generated by the tree and the aforementioned process.The number of inversions in an array a is the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a_i > a_j. For example, the array [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4).
1283	Inverse Inversions You were playing with permutation p of length n, but you lost it in Blair, Alabama!Luckily, you remember some information about the permutation. More specifically, you remember an array b of length n, where b_i is the number of indices j such that j < i and p_j > p_i.You have the array b, and you want to find the permutation p. However, your memory isn't perfect, and you constantly change the values of b as you learn more. For the next q seconds, one of the following things happen:Answer the queries, so you can remember the array!
1284	Tasty Dishes There are n chefs numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n that must prepare dishes for a king. Chef i has skill i and initially has a dish of tastiness a_i where |a_i| \leq i. Each chef has a list of other chefs that he is allowed to copy from. To stop chefs from learning bad habits, the king makes sure that chef i can only copy from chefs of larger skill.There are a sequence of days that pass during which the chefs can work on their dish. During each day, there are two stages during which a chef can change the tastiness of their dish. All chefs work to maximize the tastiness of their  dish in order to please the king.Finally, you are given q queries. Each query is one of two types.Note that queries of type 1 are independent of each all other queries. Specifically, each query of type 1 is a  and does not change the initial tastiness a_i of any dish for future queries. Note that queries of type 2 are cumulative and only change the initial tastiness a_i of a dish. See notes for an example of queries.
1285	Pretty Permutations There are n cats in a line, labeled from 1 to n, with the i-th cat at position i. They are bored of gyrating in the same spot all day, so they want to reorder themselves such that no cat is in the same place as before. They are also lazy, so they want to minimize the total distance they move. Help them decide what cat should be at each location after the reordering.For example, if there are 3 cats, this is a valid reordering: [3, 1, 2]. No cat is in its original position. The total distance the cats move is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 as cat 1 moves one place to the right, cat 2 moves one place to the right, and cat 3 moves two places to the left.
1286	Pleasant Pairs You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n consisting of n  integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a_i \cdot a_j = i + j.
1287	Odd Set You are given a multiset (i. e. a set that can contain multiple equal integers) containing 2n integers. Determine if you can split it into exactly n pairs (i. e. each element should be in exactly one pair) so that the sum of the two elements in each pair is  (i. e. when divided by 2, the remainder is 1).
1288	Plus and Multiply There is an infinite set generated as follows:For example, when a=3 and b=6, the five smallest elements of the set are:Given positive integers a, b, n, determine if n is in this set.
1289	Strange Function Let f(i) denote the minimum positive integer x such that x is  a divisor of i.Compute \sum_{i=1}^n f(i) modulo 10^9+7. In other words, compute f(1)+f(2)+\dots+f(n) modulo 10^9+7.
1290	Priority Queue You are given a sequence A, where its elements are either in the form  or , where x is an integer.For such a sequence S where its elements are either in the form  or , define f(S) as follows:The sequence b is a subsequence of the sequence a if b can be derived from a by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For all A's subsequences B, compute the sum of f(B), modulo 998\,244\,353.
1291	Exciting Bets Welcome to Rockport City!It is time for your first ever race in the game against Ronnie. To make the race interesting, you have bet a dollars and Ronnie has bet b dollars. But the fans seem to be disappointed. The excitement of the fans is given by gcd(a,b), where gcd(x, y) denotes the  of integers x and y. To make the race more exciting, you can perform two types of operations:In one move, you can perform any one of these operations. You can perform arbitrary (possibly zero) number of moves. Determine the maximum excitement the fans can get and the minimum number of moves required to achieve it.Note that gcd(x,0)=x for any x \ge 0.
1292	Customising the Track Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into n sub-tracks. You are given an array a where a_i represents the number of traffic cars in the i-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^{n} \lvert a_i-a_j\rvert, where |x| is the absolute value of x. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.
1293	Need for Pink Slips After defeating a Blacklist Rival, you get a chance to draw 1 reward slip out of x hidden valid slips. Initially, x=3 and these hidden valid slips are Cash Slip, Impound Strike Release Marker and Pink Slip of Rival's Car. Initially, the probability of drawing these in a random guess are c, m, and p, respectively. There is also a volatility factor v. You can play any number of Rival Races as long as you don't draw a Pink Slip. Assume that you win each race and get a chance to draw a reward slip. In each draw, you draw one of the x valid items with their respective probabilities. Suppose you draw a particular item and its probability of drawing before the draw was a. Then,For example,You need the cars of Rivals. So, you need to find the expected number of races that you must play in order to draw a pink slip.
1294	The Final Pursuit Finally, you have defeated Razor and now, you are the Most Wanted street racer. Sergeant Cross has sent the full police force after you in a deadly pursuit. Fortunately, you have found a hiding spot but you fear that Cross and his force will eventually find you. To increase your chances of survival, you want to tune and repaint your BMW M3 GTR.The car can be imagined as a  n-dimensional hypercube. A simple n-dimensional hypercube is an undirected unweighted graph built recursively as follows: A permuted n-dimensional hypercube is formed by permuting the vertex numbers of a simple n-dimensional hypercube in any arbitrary manner.Examples of a simple and permuted 3-dimensional hypercubes are given below:Note that a permuted n-dimensional hypercube has the following properties: Let's denote the permutation used to generate the permuted n-dimensional hypercube, representing your car, from a simple n-dimensional hypercube by P. Before messing up the functionalities of the car, you want to find this permutation so that you can restore the car if anything goes wrong. But the job isn't done yet.You have n different colours numbered from 0 to n-1. You want to colour the vertices of this permuted n-dimensional hypercube in such a way that for each and every vertex u satisfying 0\leq u < 2^n and for each and every colour c satisfying 0\leq c < n, there is at least one vertex v adjacent to u having a colour c. In other words, from each and every vertex, it must be possible to reach a vertex of any colour by just moving to an adjacent vertex. Given the permuted n-dimensional hypercube, find any valid permutation P and colouring.
1295	AquaMoon and Strange Sort AquaMoon has n friends. They stand in a row from left to right, and the i-th friend from the left wears a T-shirt with a number a_i written on it. Each friend has a direction (left or right). In the beginning, the direction of each friend is .AquaMoon can make some operations on friends. On each operation, AquaMoon can choose two  friends and swap their positions. After each operation, the direction of both chosen friends will also be flipped: left to right and vice versa.AquaMoon hopes that after some operations, the numbers written on the T-shirt of n friends in the row, read from left to right, become . Also she wants, that all friends will have a direction of  at the end. Please find if it is possible.
1296	AquaMoon and Chess Cirno gave AquaMoon a chessboard of size 1 \times n. Its cells are numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right. In the beginning, some of the cells are occupied with at most one pawn, and other cells are unoccupied.In each operation, AquaMoon can choose a cell i with a pawn, and do  of the following (if possible): You are given an initial state of the chessboard. AquaMoon wants to count the number of states reachable from the initial state with some sequence of operations. But she is not good at programming. Can you help her? As the answer can be large find it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1297	AquaMoon and Permutations Cirno has prepared n arrays of length n each. Each array is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n. These arrays are special: for all 1 \leq i \leq n, if we take the i-th element of each array and form another array of length n with these elements, the resultant array is also a permutation of n integers from 1 to n. In the other words, if you put these n arrays under each other to form a matrix with n rows and n columns, this matrix is a .Afterwards, Cirno added additional n arrays, each array is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n. For all 1 \leq i \leq n, there exists  position 1 \leq k \leq n, such that for the i-th array and the (n + i)-th array, the k-th element of both arrays is the same. Notice that the arrays indexed from n + 1 to 2n  form a Latin square. Also, Cirno made sure that for all 2n arrays, no two arrays are completely equal, i. e. for all pair of indices 1 \leq i < j \leq 2n, there exists  position 1 \leq k \leq n, such that the k-th elements of the i-th and j-th array are .Finally, Cirno arbitrarily changed the order of 2n arrays.AquaMoon calls a subset of all 2n arrays of size n  if these arrays from a Latin square.AquaMoon wants to know how many good subsets exist. Because this number may be particularly large, find it modulo 998\,244\,353. Also, she wants to find any good subset. Can you help her?
1298	AquaMoon and Wrong Coordinate Cirno gives AquaMoon a problem. There are m people numbered from 0 to m - 1. They are standing on a coordinate axis in points with positive integer coordinates. They are facing right (i.e. in the direction of the coordinate increase). At this moment everyone will start running with the constant speed in the direction of coordinate increasing. The initial coordinate of the i-th person on the line is x_i, and the speed of the i-th person is v_i. So the coordinate of the i-th person at the moment t will be x_i + t \cdot v_i.Cirno captured the coordinates of m people in k consecutive integer moments from 0 to k - 1. In every moment, the coordinates of m people were recorded in .To make the problem more funny, Cirno modified one coordinate at the moment y (0 < y < k-1) to a  integer.AquaMoon wants to find the moment y and the original coordinate p before the modification. Actually, she is not a programmer at all. So she wasn't able to solve it. Can you help her?
1299	AquaMoon and Potatoes AquaMoon has three integer arrays a, b, c of length n, where 1 \leq a_i, b_i, c_i \leq n for all i.In order to accelerate her potato farming, she organizes her farm in a manner based on these three arrays. She is now going to complete m operations to count how many potatoes she can get. Each operation will have one of the two types:As AquaMoon is busy finding the library, help her complete all of their operations.
1300	AquaMoon and Two Arrays AquaMoon and Cirno are playing an interesting game with arrays. Cirno has prepared two arrays a and b, both consist of n non-negative integers. AquaMoon can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):AquaMoon wants to make some operations to make arrays a and b equal. Two arrays a and b are considered equal if and only if a_i = b_i for all 1 \leq i \leq n.Help AquaMoon to find a sequence of operations that will solve her problem or find, that it is impossible to make arrays a and b equal.Please note, that you  the number of operations.
1301	AquaMoon and Stolen String AquaMoon had n strings of length m each. n is an  number.When AquaMoon was gone, Cirno tried to pair these n strings together. After making \frac{n-1}{2} pairs, she found out that there was exactly one string without the pair!In her rage, she disrupted each pair of strings. For each pair, she selected some positions (at least 1 and at most m) and swapped the letters in the two strings of this pair at the selected positions.For example, if m = 6 and two strings "" and "" are in one pair and Cirno selected positions 2, 3 and 6 she will swap '' with '', '' with '' and '' with ''. The resulting strings will be "" and "".Cirno then stole away the string without pair and shuffled all remaining strings in arbitrary order.AquaMoon found the remaining n-1 strings in complete disarray. Also, she remembers the initial n strings. She wants to know which string was stolen, but she is not good at programming. Can you help her?
1302	Shortest Path with Obstacle There are three cells on an infinite 2-dimensional grid, labeled A, B, and F. Find the length of the shortest path from A to B if: 
1303	Alphabetical Strings A string s of length n (1 \le n \le 26) is called  if it can be obtained using the following algorithm:In other words, iterate over the n first letters of the Latin alphabet starting from '' and etc. Each time we prepend a letter to the left of the string s or append a letter to the right of the string s. Strings that can be obtained in that way are alphabetical.For example, the following strings are alphabetical: "", "", "", "" and "". The following strings  alphabetical: "", "", "", "", "" and "".From the given string, determine if it is alphabetical.
1304	Pair Programming Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.
1305	Co-growing Sequence A sequence of non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n is called  if for all i from 1 to n - 1 all ones (of binary representation) in a_i are in the places of ones (of binary representation) in a_{i + 1} (in other words, a_i \:\&\: a_{i + 1} = a_i, where \& denotes ). If n = 1 then the sequence is considered  as well.For example, the following four sequences are growing: The following three sequences are non-growing: Consider two sequences of non-negative integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n and y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n. Let's call this pair of sequences  if the sequence x_1 \oplus y_1, x_2 \oplus y_2, \dots, x_n \oplus y_n is  where \oplus denotes .You are given a sequence of integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n. Find the lexicographically minimal sequence y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n such that sequences x_i and y_i are co-growing.The sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n is lexicographically smaller than the sequence b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n if there exists 1 \le k \le n such that a_i = b_i for any 1 \le i < k but a_k < b_k.
1306	Air Conditioners On a strip of land of length n there are k air conditioners: the i-th air conditioner is placed in cell a_i (1 \le a_i \le n). Two or more air conditioners cannot be placed in the same cell (i.e. all a_i are distinct).Each air conditioner is characterized by one parameter: temperature. The i-th air conditioner is set to the temperature t_i.For each cell i (1 \le i \le n) find it's temperature, that can be calculated by the formula \min_{1 \le j \le k}(t_j + |a_j - i|),where |a_j - i| denotes absolute value of the difference a_j - i.In other words, the temperature in cell i is equal to the minimum among the temperatures of air conditioners, increased by the distance from it to the cell i.Let's look at an example. Consider that n=6, k=2, the first air conditioner is placed in cell a_1=2 and is set to the temperature t_1=14 and the second air conditioner is placed in cell a_2=5 and is set to the temperature t_2=16. In that case temperatures in cells are:For each cell from 1 to n find the temperature in it.
1307	Array Stabilization (GCD version) You are given an array of positive integers a = [a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n - 1}] (n \ge 2).In one step, the array a is replaced with another array of length n, in which each element is the  of two neighboring elements (the element itself and its right neighbor; consider that the right neighbor of the (n - 1)-th element is the 0-th element).Formally speaking, a new array b = [b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{n - 1}] is being built from array a = [a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n - 1}] such that b_i = \gcd(a_i, a_{(i + 1) \mod n}), where \gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and x \mod y is the remainder of x dividing by y. In one step the array b is built and then the array a is replaced with b (that is, the assignment a  b is taking place).For example, if a = [16, 24, 10, 5] then b = [\gcd(16, 24), \gcd(24, 10), \gcd(10, 5), \gcd(5, 16)] = [8, 2, 5, 1]. Thus, after one step the array a = [16, 24, 10, 5] will be equal to [8, 2, 5, 1].For a given array a, find the minimum number of steps after which all values a_i become equal (that is, a_0 = a_1 = \dots = a_{n - 1}). If the original array a consists of identical elements then consider the number of steps is equal to 0.
1308	Web of Lies There are n nobles, numbered from 1 to n. Noble i has a power of i. There are also m "friendships". A friendship between nobles a and b is always mutual.A noble is defined to be  if both of the following conditions are satisfied: You will have to process the following three types of queries. The process: all vulnerable nobles are simultaneously killed, and all their friendships end. Then, it is possible that new nobles become vulnerable. The process repeats itself until no nobles are vulnerable. It can be proven that the process will end in finite time. After the process is complete, you need to calculate the number of remaining nobles.Note that the results of the process are  carried over between queries, that is, every process starts with all nobles being alive!
1309	Integers Have Friends British mathematician John Littlewood once said about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan that "every positive integer was one of his personal friends."It turns out that positive integers can also be friends with each other! You are given an array a of distinct positive integers. Define a  a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j to be a  if and only if there exists an integer m \ge 2 such that a_i \bmod m = a_{i+1} \bmod m = \ldots = a_j \bmod m, where x \bmod y denotes the remainder when x is divided by y.Your friend Gregor wants to know the size of the largest friend group in a.
1310	The Three Little Pigs Three little pigs from all over the world are meeting for a convention! Every minute, a triple of 3 new pigs arrives on the convention floor. After the n-th minute, the convention ends.The big bad wolf has learned about this convention, and he has an attack plan. At some minute in the convention, he will arrive and eat exactly x pigs. Then he will get away.The wolf wants Gregor to help him figure out the number of possible attack plans that involve eating exactly x pigs for various values of x (1 \le x \le 3n). Two attack plans are considered different, if they occur at different times or if the sets of little pigs to eat are different.Note that all queries are independent, that is, the wolf does not eat the little pigs, he only makes plans!
1311	Gregor and the Two Painters Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an n \times m grid.For each i between 1 and n, inclusive, painter Amin applies a_i layers of paint to the entire i-th row. For each j between 1 and m, inclusive, painter Benj applies b_j layers of paint to the entire j-th column. Therefore, the cell (i,j) ends up with a_i+b_j layers of paint.Gregor considers the cell (i,j) to be  if a_i+b_j \le x. Define a  to be a  connected component of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.
1312	Gregor and Cryptography Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.Gregor's favorite  number is P. Gregor wants to find two  of P. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers a and b which satisfy both of the following properties.Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!
1313	Gregor and the Pawn Game There is a chessboard of size n by n. The square in the i-th row from top and j-th column from the left is labelled (i,j).Currently, Gregor has some pawns in the n-th row. There are also enemy pawns in the 1-st row. On one turn, Gregor moves one of  pawns. A pawn can move one square up (from (i,j) to (i-1,j)) if there is no pawn in the destination square. Additionally, a pawn can move one square diagonally up (from (i,j) to either (i-1,j-1) or (i-1,j+1)) if and only if there is an enemy pawn in that square. The enemy pawn is also removed.Gregor wants to know what is the maximum number of his pawns that can reach row 1?Note that only Gregor takes turns in this game, and . Also, when Gregor's pawn reaches row 1, it is stuck and cannot make any further moves.
1314	Find The Array Let's call an array a consisting of n positive (greater than 0) integers  if the following condition is held for every i from 1 to n: either a_i = 1, or at least one of the numbers a_i - 1 and a_i - 2 exists in the array as well.For example: You are given a positive integer s. Find the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to s.
1315	Maximum Cost Deletion You are given a string s of length n consisting only of the characters  and .You perform the following operation until the string becomes empty: choose some  substring of  characters, erase it from the string and glue the remaining two parts together (any of them can be empty) in the same order. For example, if you erase the substring  from the string , you will get the string . When you delete a substring of length l, you get a \cdot l + b points.Your task is to calculate the maximum number of points that you can score in total, if you have to make the given string empty.
1316	Manhattan Subarrays Suppose you have two points p = (x_p, y_p) and q = (x_q, y_q). Let's denote the Manhattan distance between them as d(p, q) = |x_p - x_q| + |y_p - y_q|.Let's say that three points p, q, r form a  triple if d(p, r) = d(p, q) + d(q, r).Let's say that an array b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m is  if it is impossible to choose three  indices i, j, k such that the points (b_i, i), (b_j, j) and (b_k, k) form a bad triple.You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Calculate the number of  subarrays of a. A subarray of the array a is the array a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r for some 1 \le l \le r \le n.Note that, according to the definition, subarrays of length 1 and 2 are .
1317	Excellent Arrays Let's call an integer array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n  if a_i \neq i for each i.Let F(a) be the number of pairs (i, j) (1 \le i < j \le n) such that a_i + a_j = i + j.Let's say that an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n is  if: Given n, l and r, calculate the number of  arrays modulo 10^9 + 7.
1318	Stringforces You are given a string s of length n. Each character is either one of the first k lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.You are asked to replace every question mark with one of the first k lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized.Let f_i be the maximum length substring of string s, which consists entirely of the i-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the i-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then f_i is equal to 0.The value of a string s is the minimum value among f_i for all i from 1 to k.What is the maximum value the string can have?
1319	Jumping Around There is an infinite pond that can be represented with a number line. There are n rocks in the pond, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th rock is located at an integer coordinate a_i. The coordinates of the rocks are pairwise distinct. The rocks are numbered in the increasing order of the coordinate, so a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n.A robot frog sits on the rock number s. The frog is programmable. It has a base jumping distance parameter d. There also is a setting for the jumping distance range. If the jumping distance range is set to some integer k, then the frog can jump from some rock to any rock at a distance from d - k to d + k inclusive in any direction. The distance between two rocks is an absolute difference between their coordinates.You are assigned a task to implement a feature for the frog. Given two integers i and k determine if the frog can reach a rock number i from a rock number s performing a sequence of jumps with the jumping distance range set to k. The sequence can be arbitrarily long or empty.You will be given q testcases for that feature, the j-th testcase consists of two integers i and k. Print "" if the i-th rock is reachable and "" otherwise.You can output "" and "" in any case (for example, strings "", "", "" and '"' will be recognized as a positive answer).
1320	Polycarp and Coins Polycarp must pay  n burles at the checkout. He has coins of two nominal values: 1 burle and 2 burles. Polycarp likes both kinds of coins equally. So he doesn't want to pay with more coins of one type than with the other.Thus, Polycarp wants to minimize the difference between the count of coins of 1 burle and 2 burles being used. Help him by determining two non-negative integer values c_1 and c_2 which are the number of coins of 1 burle and 2 burles, respectively, so that the total value of that number of coins is  n (i. e. c_1 + 2 \cdot c_2 = n), and the absolute value of the difference between c_1 and c_2 is as little as possible (i. e. you must minimize |c_1-c_2|).
1321	Interesting Story Stephen Queen wants to write a story. He is a very unusual writer, he uses only letters '', '', '', '' and ''!To compose a story, Stephen wrote out n words consisting of the first 5 lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. He wants to select the  number of  to make an  story.Let a story be a sequence of words that are not necessarily different. A story is called  if there exists a letter which occurs among all words of the story more times than all other letters together.For example, the story consisting of three words "", "", "" is interesting (the letter '' occurs 5 times, all other letters occur 4 times in total). But the story consisting of two words "", "" is not (no such letter that it occurs more than all other letters in total).You are given a sequence of n words consisting of letters '', '', '', '' and ''. Your task is to choose the maximum number of them to make an interesting story. If there's no way to make a non-empty story, output 0.
1322	Fixed Points Consider a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. In one move, you can select any element of the sequence and delete it. After an element is deleted, all elements to the right are shifted to the left by 1 position, so there are no empty spaces in the sequence. So after you make a move, the sequence's length decreases by 1. The indices of the elements after the move are recalculated.E. g. let the sequence be a=[3, 2, 2, 1, 5]. Let's select the element a_3=2 in a move. Then after the move the sequence will be equal to a=[3, 2, 1, 5], so the 3-rd element of the new sequence will be a_3=1 and the 4-th element will be a_4=5.You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and a number k. You need to find the minimum number of moves you have to make so that in the resulting sequence there will be  k elements that are equal to their indices, i. e. the resulting sequence b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m will contain at least k indices i such that b_i = i.
1323	Equidistant Vertices A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.You are given a tree of n vertices. Find the number of ways to choose exactly k vertices in this tree (i. e. a k-element subset of vertices) so that all pairwise distances between the selected vertices are equal (in other words, there exists an integer c such that for all u, v (u \ne v, u, v are in selected vertices) d_{u,v}=c, where d_{u,v} is the distance from u to v).Since the answer may be very large, you need to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.
1324	Subsequence Permutation A string s of length n, consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, is given.You must choose some number k between 0 and n. Then, you select k characters of s and permute them however you want. In this process, the positions of the other n-k characters remain unchanged. You have to perform this operation exactly once.For example, if s=\texttt{"andrea"}, you can choose the k=4 characters \texttt{"a_d_ea"} and permute them into \texttt{"d_e_aa"} so that after the operation the string becomes \texttt{"dneraa"}.Determine the minimum k so that it is possible to sort s alphabetically (that is, after the operation its characters appear in alphabetical order).
1325	Running for Gold The Olympic Games have just started and Federico is eager to watch the marathon race.There will be n athletes, numbered from 1 to n, competing in the marathon, and all of them have taken part in 5 important marathons, numbered from 1 to 5, in the past. For each 1\le i\le n and 1\le j\le 5, Federico remembers that athlete i ranked r_{i,j}-th in marathon j (e.g., r_{2,4}=3 means that athlete 2 was third in marathon 4).Federico considers athlete x superior to athlete y if athlete x ranked better than athlete y in at least 3 past marathons, i.e., r_{x,j}<r_{y,j} for at least 3 distinct values of j.Federico believes that an athlete is likely to get the gold medal at the Olympics if he is superior to all other athletes.Find any athlete who is likely to get the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other athletes), or determine that there is no such athlete.
1326	Maximize the Intersections On a circle lie 2n distinct points, with the following property: however you choose 3 chords that connect 3 disjoint pairs of points, no point strictly inside the circle belongs to all 3 chords. The points are numbered 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, 2n in clockwise order.Initially, k chords connect k pairs of points, in such a way that all the 2k endpoints of these chords are distinct.You want to draw n - k additional chords that connect the remaining 2(n - k) points (each point must be an endpoint of exactly one chord).In the end, let x be the total number of intersections among all n chords. Compute the maximum value that x can attain if you choose the n - k chords optimally.Note that the exact position of the 2n points is not relevant, as long as the property stated in the first paragraph holds.
1327	Array Differentiation You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, \, a_2, \, \dots, \, a_n.Does there exist a sequence of n integers b_1, \, b_2, \, \dots, \, b_n such that the following property holds?
1328	Colors and Intervals The numbers 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, n \cdot k are colored with n colors. These colors are indexed by 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, n. For each 1 \le i \le n, there are exactly k numbers colored with color i.Let [a, \, b] denote the interval of integers between a and b inclusive, that is, the set \{a, \, a + 1, \, \dots, \, b\}. You must choose n intervals [a_1, \, b_1], \, [a_2, \, b_2], \, \dots, [a_n, \, b_n] such that: One can show that such a family of intervals always exists under the given constraints.
1329	Telepanting An ant moves on the real line with constant speed of 1 unit per second. It starts at 0 and always moves to the right (so its position increases by 1 each second).There are n portals, the i-th of which is located at position x_i and teleports to position y_i < x_i. Each portal can be either  or . The initial state of the i-th portal is determined by s_i: if s_i=0 then the i-th portal is initially inactive, if s_i=1 then the i-th portal is initially active. When the ant travels through a portal (i.e., when its position coincides with the position of a portal): How long (from the instant it starts moving) does it take for the ant to reach the position x_n + 1? It can be shown that this happens in a finite amount of time. Since the answer may be very large, compute it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1330	Digits Sum Let's define S(x) to be the sum of digits of number x written in decimal system. For example, S(5) = 5, S(10) = 1, S(322) = 7.We will call an integer x  if S(x + 1) < S(x). In each test you will be given one integer n. Your task is to calculate the number of integers x such that 1 \le x \le n and x is interesting.
1331	Reverse String You have a string s and a chip, which you can place onto any character of this string. After placing the chip, you move it to the right several (maybe zero) times, i. e. you perform the following operation several times: if the current position of the chip is i, you move it to the position i + 1. Of course, moving the chip to the right is impossible if it is already in the last position.After moving the chip to the right, you move it to the left several (maybe zero) times, i. e. you perform the following operation several times: if the current position of the chip is i, you move it to the position i - 1. Of course, moving the chip to the left is impossible if it is already in the first position.When you place a chip or move it, you write down the character where the chip ends up after your action. For example, if s is , you place the chip onto the 3-rd character, move it to the right 2 times and then move it to the left 3 times, you write down the string .You are given two strings s and t. Your task is to determine whether it's possible to perform the described operations with s so that you write down the string t as a result.
1332	Penalty Consider a simplified penalty phase at the end of a football match.A penalty phase consists of at most 10 kicks, the first team takes the first kick, the second team takes the second kick, then the first team takes the third kick, and so on. The team that scores more goals wins; if both teams score the same number of goals, the game results in a tie (). The penalty phase is stopped if one team has scored more goals than the other team could reach with all of its remaining kicks. For example, if after the 7-th kick the first team has scored 1 goal, and the second team has scored 3 goals, the penalty phase ends — the first team cannot reach 3 goals.You know which player will be taking each kick, so you have your predictions for each of the 10 kicks. These predictions are represented by a string s consisting of 10 characters. Each character can either be , , or . This string represents your predictions in the following way:Based on your predictions, you have to calculate the minimum possible number of kicks there can be in the penalty phase (that means, the earliest moment when the penalty phase is stopped, considering all possible ways it could go). Note that  — you may know that some kick will/won't be scored, but the referee doesn't.
1333	Backspace You are given two strings s and t, both consisting of lowercase English letters. You are going to type the string s character by character, from the first character to the last one.When typing a character, instead of pressing the button corresponding to it, you can press the "Backspace" button. It deletes the last character you have typed among those that aren't deleted yet (or does nothing if there are no characters in the current string). For example, if s is "" and you press Backspace instead of typing the first and the fourth characters, you will get the string "" (the first press of Backspace deletes no character, and the second press deletes the character ''). Another example, if s is "" and you press Backspace instead of the last two letters, then the resulting text is "".Your task is to determine whether you can obtain the string t, if you type the string s and press "Backspace" instead of typing several (maybe zero) characters of s.
1334	Permutation Shift An identity permutation of length n is an array [1, 2, 3, \dots, n].We performed the following operations to an identity permutation of length n:You are given the values of n and m, and the resulting array. Your task is to find all possible values of k in the cyclic shift operation.
1335	Pairwise Modulo You have an array a consisting of n distinct positive integers, numbered from 1 to n. Define p_k as p_k = \sum_{1 \le i, j \le k} a_i \bmod a_j, where x \bmod y denotes the remainder when x is divided by y. You have to find and print p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.

1337	Cobb You are given n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and an integer k. Find the maximum value of i \cdot j - k \cdot (a_i | a_j) over all pairs (i, j) of integers with 1 \le i < j \le n. Here, | is the .
1338	Mikasa You are given two integers n and m. Find the \operatorname{MEX} of the sequence n \oplus 0, n \oplus 1, \ldots, n \oplus m. Here, \oplus is the .\operatorname{MEX} of the sequence of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't appear in this sequence. For example, \operatorname{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 4) = 3, and \operatorname{MEX}(1, 2021) = 0. 
1339	Diane You are given an integer n. Find any string s of length n consisting only of English lowercase letters such that each non-empty substring of s occurs in s an  number of times. If there are multiple such strings, output any. It can be shown that such string always exists under the given constraints.A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
1340	You You are given a tree with n nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.Let a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation  n times: For each integer k from 1 to n, find the number, modulo 998\,244\,353, of different sequences a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n that satisfy the following conditions:
1341	PizzaForces PizzaForces is Petya's favorite pizzeria. PizzaForces makes and sells pizzas of three sizes: small pizzas consist of 6 slices, medium ones consist of 8 slices, and large pizzas consist of 10 slices each. Baking them takes 15, 20 and 25 minutes, respectively.Petya's birthday is today, and n of his friends will come, so he decided to make an order from his favorite pizzeria. Petya wants to order so much pizza that each of his friends gets at least one slice of pizza. The cooking time of the order is the total baking time of all the pizzas in the order.Your task is to determine the minimum number of minutes that is needed to make pizzas containing at least n slices in total. For example: 
1342	Two Tables You have an axis-aligned rectangle room with width W and height H, so the lower left corner is in point (0, 0) and the upper right corner is in (W, H).There is a rectangular table standing in this room. The sides of the table are parallel to the walls, the lower left corner is in (x_1, y_1), and the upper right corner in (x_2, y_2).You want to place another rectangular table in this room with width w and height h with the width of the table parallel to the width of the room.The problem is that sometimes there is not enough space to place the second table without intersecting with the first one (there are no problems with tables touching, though).You  any of the tables, but you can move the first table inside the room. What is the minimum distance you should move the first table to free enough space for the second one?
1343	Coin Rows Alice and Bob are playing a game on a matrix, consisting of 2 rows and m columns. The cell in the i-th row in the j-th column contains a_{i, j} coins in it.Initially, both Alice and Bob are standing in a cell (1, 1). They are going to perform a sequence of moves to reach a cell (2, m).The possible moves are: First, Alice makes  until she reaches (2, m). She collects the coins in all cells she visit (including the starting cell).When Alice finishes, Bob starts his journey. He also performs the moves to reach (2, m) and collects the coins in all cells that he visited, .The score of the game is the total number of coins Bob collects.Alice wants to minimize the score. Bob wants to maximize the score. What will the score of the game be if both players play optimally?
1344	Say No to Palindromes Let's call the string  if it does not contain a substring of length at least 2, which is a palindrome. Recall that a palindrome is a string that reads the same way from the first character to the last and from the last character to the first. For example, the strings , , ,  are palindromes, but the strings , ,  are not.Let's define  of a string as the minimum number of operations so that the string becomes beautiful, if in one operation it is allowed to change any character of the string to one of the first 3 letters of the Latin alphabet (in lowercase).You are given a string s of length n, each character of the string is one of the first 3 letters of the Latin alphabet (in lowercase).You have to answer m queries — calculate the cost of the substring of the string s from l_i-th to r_i-th position, inclusive.
1345	Boring Segments You are given n segments on a number line, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th segments covers all integer points from l_i to r_i and has a value w_i.You are asked to select a subset of these segments (possibly, all of them). Once the subset is selected, it's possible to travel between two integer points if there exists a selected segment that covers both of them. A subset is good if it's possible to reach point m starting from point 1 in arbitrary number of moves.The cost of the subset is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of segments in it. Find the minimum cost of a good subset.In every test there exists at least one good subset.
1346	Good Graph You have an undirected graph consisting of n vertices with weighted edges.A simple cycle is a cycle of the graph without repeated vertices. Let the  of the cycle be the  of weights of edges it consists of.Let's say the graph is  if all its  cycles have weight 1. A graph is bad if it's not good.Initially, the graph is empty. Then q queries follow. Each query has the next type: For each query print, was the edge added or not.
1347	A Variety of Operations William has two numbers a and b initially both equal to . William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer k is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose a  positive integer k)Note that after performing operations, numbers a and b may become negative as well.William wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make a equal to his favorite number c and b equal to his second favorite number d.
1348	Take Your Places! William has an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. In one move he can swap two neighboring items. Two items a_i and a_j are considered neighboring if the condition |i - j| = 1 is satisfied.William wants you to calculate the minimal number of swaps he would need to perform to make it so that the array does not contain two neighboring items with the same parity.
1349	Compressed Bracket Sequence William has a favorite bracket sequence. Since his favorite sequence is quite big he provided it to you as a sequence of positive integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n where c_i is the number of consecutive brackets "" if i is an odd number or the number of consecutive brackets "" if i is an even number.For example for a bracket sequence "" a corresponding sequence of numbers is [3, 2, 1, 3].You need to find the total number of continuous subsequences (subsegments) [l, r] (l \le r) of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "" and "" into this sequence. For example, sequences "", "" and "" are regular, while "", "" and "" are not.
1350	Take a Guess William has a certain sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than 2 \cdot n of the following questions:You can ask William these questions and you need to find the k-th smallest number of the sequence.Formally the k-th smallest number is equal to the number at the k-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array [5, 3, 3, 10, 1] 4th smallest number is equal to 5, and 2nd and 3rd are 3.
1351	Equilibrium William has two arrays a and b, each consisting of n items.For some segments l..r of these arrays William wants to know if it is possible to equalize the values of items in these segments using a balancing operation. Formally, the values are equalized if for each i from l to r holds a_i = b_i.To perform a balancing operation an even number of indices must be selected, such that l \le pos_1 < pos_2 < \dots < pos_k \le r. Next the items of  at positions pos_1, pos_3, pos_5, \dots get incremented by one and the items of  at positions pos_2, pos_4, pos_6, \dots get incremented by one.William wants to find out if it is possible to equalize the values of elements in two arrays for each segment using some number of balancing operations, and what is the minimal number of operations required for that. Note that for each segment the operations are performed independently.
1352	Sports Betting William is not only interested in trading but also in betting on sports matches. n teams participate in each match. Each team is characterized by strength a_i. Each two teams i < j play with each other exactly once. Team i wins with probability \frac{a_i}{a_i + a_j} and team j wins with probability \frac{a_j}{a_i + a_j}.The team is called a winner if it directly or indirectly defeated all other teams. Team a defeated (directly or indirectly) team b if there is a sequence of teams c_1, c_2, ... c_k such that c_1 = a, c_k = b and team c_i defeated team c_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1. Note that it is possible that team a defeated team b and in the same time team b defeated team a.William wants you to find the expected value of the number of winners.
1353	Ezzat and Two Subsequences Ezzat has an array of n integers . He wants to split it into two  subsequences a and b, such that every element from the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of f(a) + f(b) is the maximum possible value, where f(x) is the average of the subsequence x. A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained from y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of this subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence.For example, the average of [1,5,6] is (1+5+6)/3 = 12/3 = 4, so f([1,5,6]) = 4.
1354	Moamen and k-subarrays Moamen has an array of n  integers. He wants to sort that array in non-decreasing order by doing the following operations in order :A sequence a is a subarray of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.Can you tell Moamen if there is a way to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operations written above?
1355	Moamen and XOR Moamen and Ezzat are playing a game. They create an array a of n non-negative integers where every element is less than 2^k.Moamen wins if a_1 \,\&\, a_2 \,\&\, a_3 \,\&\, \ldots \,\&\, a_n \ge a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_n.Here \& denotes the , and \oplus denotes the .Please calculate the number of winning for Moamen arrays a.As the result may be very large, print the value modulo 1\,000\,000\,007 (10^9 + 7).
1356	Ezzat and Grid Moamen was drawing a grid of n rows and 10^9 columns containing only digits 0 and 1. Ezzat noticed what Moamen was drawing and became interested in the minimum number of rows one needs to remove to make the grid beautiful.A grid is beautiful if and only if for every two consecutive rows there is at least one column containing 1 in these two rows.Ezzat will give you the number of rows n, and m segments of the grid that contain digits 1. Every segment is represented with three integers i, l, and r, where i represents the row number, and l and r represent the first and the last column of the segment in that row.For example, if n = 3, m = 6, and the segments are (1,1,1), (1,7,8), (2,7,7), (2,15,15), (3,1,1), (3,15,15), then the grid is:Your task is to tell Ezzat the minimum number of rows that should be removed to make the grid beautiful.
1357	Assiut Chess ICPC Assiut Community decided to hold a unique chess contest, and you were chosen to control a queen and hunt down the hidden king, while a member of ICPC Assiut Community controls this king.You compete on an 8\times8 chessboard, the rows are numerated from top to bottom, and the columns are numerated left to right, and the cell in row x and column y is denoted as (x, y).In one turn you can move the queen to any of the squares on the same horizontal line, vertical line, or any of the diagonals. For example, if the queen was on square (4, 5), you can move to (q_1, 5), (4, q_1), (q_1, 9-q_1), or (q_2, q_2+1) where (1 \le q_1 \le 8, q_1 \ne 4, 1 \le q_2 \le 7, q_2 \ne 4). Note that the queen  stay on its current cell. In one turn, the king can move "Right", "Left", "Up", "Down", "Down-Right", "Down-Left", "Up-Left", or "Up-Right" such that he doesn't get out of the board. The king  move into a cell that is on the same row, column or diagonal with the queen (including the position of the queen itself). For example, if the king was on square (4, 5), he can move to (4+k_1, 5+k_2) where (-1 \le k_1,k_2 \le 1, (k_1, k_2) \ne (0, 0)). At the start of the game, you should place the queen at any location on the board, and this is done once per game. After that the king is secretly placed at any cell different from the queen's location. You do not know the position of the king. Then, the king and the queen take turns with the king moving first. The king moves to one of the possible directions ("Right", "Down", "Up-Left", etc.), and you are only given the direction it moves to. After that, you should move your queen by declaring the square to which your queen will move. The game follows like this until you win the game or run out of moves.You win if the king has no valid moves. You lose if after 130 moves of the queen the king still has valid moves.
1358	Charmed by the Game Alice and Borys are playing tennis.A tennis match consists of . In each game, one of the players is  and the other one is .Players serve in turns: after a game where Alice is serving follows a game where Borys is serving, and vice versa.Each game ends with a victory of one of the players. If a game is won by the serving player, it's said that this player . If a game is won by the receiving player, it's said that this player .It is known that Alice won a games and Borys won b games during the match. It is unknown who served first and who won which games.Find all values of k such that exactly k breaks could happen during the match between Alice and Borys in total.
1359	Up the Strip You have a vertical strip with n cells, numbered consecutively from 1 to n from top to bottom.You also have a token that is initially placed in cell n. You will move the token up until it arrives at cell 1.Let the token be in cell x > 1 at some moment. One shift of the token can have either of the following kinds: Find the number of ways to move the token from cell n to cell 1 using one or more shifts, and print it modulo m. Note that if there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considered  (check example explanation for a better understanding).
1360	Bottom-Tier Reversals You have a permutation: an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of distinct integers from 1 to n. The length of the permutation n is odd.You need to sort the permutation in increasing order.In one step, you can choose any prefix of the permutation with an odd length and reverse it. Formally, if a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n], you can choose any odd integer p between 1 and n, inclusive, and set a to [a_p, a_{p-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_{p+1}, a_{p+2}, \ldots, a_n].Find a way to sort a using no more than \frac{5n}{2} reversals of the above kind, or determine that such a way doesn't exist. The number of reversals doesn't have to be minimized.
1361	Top-Notch Insertions Consider the insertion sort algorithm used to sort an integer sequence [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of length n in non-decreasing order.For each i in order from 2 to n, do the following. If a_i \ge a_{i-1}, do nothing and move on to the next value of i. Otherwise, find the smallest j such that a_i < a_j, shift the elements on positions from j to i-1 by one position to the right, and write down the initial value of a_i to position j. In this case we'll say that we performed an  of an element from position i to position j.It can be noticed that after processing any i, the prefix of the sequence [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i] is sorted in non-decreasing order, therefore, the algorithm indeed sorts any sequence.For example, sorting [4, 5, 3, 1, 3] proceeds as follows: You are given an integer n and a list of m integer pairs (x_i, y_i). We are interested in sequences such that if you sort them using the above algorithm, exactly m insertions will be performed: first from position x_1 to position y_1, then from position x_2 to position y_2, ..., finally, from position x_m to position y_m.How many sequences of length n consisting of (not necessarily distinct) integers between 1 and n, inclusive, satisfy the above condition? Print this number modulo 998\,244\,353.
1362	Down Below In a certain video game, the player controls a hero characterized by a single integer value: .On the current level, the hero got into a system of n caves numbered from 1 to n, and m tunnels between them. Each tunnel connects two distinct caves. Any two caves are connected with at most one tunnel. Any cave can be reached from any other cave by moving via tunnels.The hero starts the level in cave 1, and every other cave contains a monster.The hero can move between caves via tunnels. If the hero leaves a cave and enters a tunnel, he must finish his movement and arrive at the opposite end of the tunnel.The hero can use each tunnel to move in both directions. However, the hero  use the same tunnel . Formally, if the hero has just moved from cave i to cave j via a tunnel, he can not head back to cave i immediately after, but he can head to any other cave connected to cave j with a tunnel.It is known that at least two tunnels come out of every cave, thus, the hero will never find himself in a dead end even considering the above requirement.To pass the level, the hero must beat the monsters in all the caves. When the hero enters a cave for the first time, he will have to fight the monster in it. The hero can beat the monster in cave i if and only if the hero's power is strictly greater than a_i. In case of beating the monster, the hero's power increases by b_i. If the hero can't beat the monster he's fighting, the game ends and the player loses.After the hero beats the monster in cave i, all subsequent visits to cave i won't have any consequences: the cave won't have any monsters, and the hero's power won't change either.Find the smallest possible power the hero must start the level with to be able to beat all the monsters and pass the level.
1363	Strange Sort You have a permutation: an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of distinct integers from 1 to n. The length of the permutation n is odd.Consider the following algorithm of sorting the permutation in increasing order.A helper procedure of the algorithm, f(i), takes a single argument i (1 \le i \le n-1) and does the following. If a_i > a_{i+1}, the values of a_i and a_{i+1} are exchanged. Otherwise, the permutation doesn't change.The algorithm consists of iterations, numbered with consecutive integers starting with 1. On the i-th iteration, the algorithm does the following: It can be proven that after a finite number of iterations the permutation will be sorted in increasing order.After how many iterations will this happen for the first time?
1364	Mocha and Math Mocha is a young girl from high school. She has learned so much interesting knowledge from her teachers, especially her math teacher. Recently, Mocha is learning about binary system and very interested in bitwise operation.This day, Mocha got a sequence a of length n. In each operation, she can select an arbitrary interval [l, r] and for all values i (0\leq i \leq r-l), replace a_{l+i} with a_{l+i} \,\&\, a_{r-i} at the same time, where \& denotes the . This operation can be performed .For example, if n=5, the array is [a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5], and Mocha selects the interval [2,5], then the new array is [a_1,a_2\,\&\, a_5, a_3\,\&\, a_4, a_4\,\&\, a_3, a_5\,\&\, a_2].Now Mocha wants to minimize the maximum value in the sequence. As her best friend, can you help her to get the answer?
1365	Mocha and Red and Blue There are n squares arranged in a row, and each of them can be painted either red or blue.Among these squares, some of them have been painted already, and the others are blank. You can decide which color to paint on each blank square.Some pairs of adjacent squares may have the same color, which is imperfect. We define the  as the number of pairs of adjacent squares that share the same color.For example, the imperfectness of "" is 3, with "" occurred once and "" occurred twice.Your goal is to minimize the imperfectness and print out the colors of the squares after painting. 
1366	Mocha and Hiking The city where Mocha lives in is called Zhijiang. There are n+1 villages and 2n-1 directed roads in this city. There are two kinds of roads:Mocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village . They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan? 
1367	Mocha and Stars Mocha wants to be an astrologer. There are n stars which can be seen in Zhijiang, and the brightness of the i-th star is a_i. Mocha considers that these n stars form a constellation, and she uses (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) to show its state. A state is called  if all of the following three conditions are satisfied:Here, \gcd(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) denotes the  of integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n.Mocha is wondering how many different mathematical states of this constellation exist. Because the answer may be large, you must find it modulo 998\,244\,353.Two states (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) and (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n) are considered different if there exists i (1\le i\le n) such that a_i \ne b_i.
1368	Dislike of Threes Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \dots. Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).
1369	Who's Opposite? Some number of people (this number is even) have stood in a circle. The people stand in the circle evenly. They are numbered clockwise starting from a person with the number 1. Each person is looking through the circle's center at the opposite person.You don't know the exact number of people standing in the circle (but this number is even, no doubt). It is known that the person with the number a is looking at the person with the number b (and vice versa, of course). What is the number associated with a person being looked at by the person with the number c? If, for the specified a, b, and c, no such circle exists, output .
1370	Infinity Table Polycarp has found a table having an infinite number of rows and columns. The rows are numbered from 1, starting from the topmost one. The columns are numbered from 1, starting from the leftmost one.Initially, the table hasn't been filled and Polycarp wants to fix it. He writes integers from 1 and so on to the table as follows.The leftmost topmost cell of the table is filled with the number 1. Then he writes in the table all positive integers beginning from 2 sequentially using the following algorithm.First, Polycarp selects the leftmost non-filled cell in the first row and fills it. Then, while the left neighbor of the last filled cell is filled, he goes down and fills the next cell. So he goes down until the last filled cell has a non-filled neighbor to the left (look at the vertical arrow going down in the figure above).After that, he fills the cells from the right to the left until he stops at the first column (look at the horizontal row in the figure above). Then Polycarp selects the leftmost non-filled cell in the first row, goes down, and so on.A friend of Polycarp has a favorite number k. He wants to know which cell will contain the number. Help him to find the indices of the row and the column, such that the intersection of the row and the column is the cell containing the number k.
1371	Make a Power of Two You are given an integer n. In 1 move, you can do one of the following actions:The actions may be performed in any order any number of times.Note that if, after deleting some digit from a number, it will contain leading zeroes, they will  be deleted. E.g. if you delete from the number 301 the digit 3, the result is the number 01 (not 1).You need to perform the  number of actions to make the number any power of 2 (i.e. there's an integer k (k \ge 0) such that the resulting number is equal to 2^k). .E.g. consider n=1052. The answer is equal to 2. First, let's add to the right one digit 4 (the result will be 10524). Then let's erase the digit 5, so the result will be 1024 which is a power of 2.E.g. consider n=8888. The answer is equal to 3. Let's erase any of the digits 8 three times. The result will be 8 which is a power of 2.
1372	Polycarp and String Transformation Polycarp has a string s. Polycarp performs the following actions until the string s is empty (t is initially an empty string):Polycarp performs this sequence of actions  in this order.Note that after Polycarp finishes the actions, the string s will be empty and the string t will be equal to some value (that is undefined and depends on the order of removing).E.g. consider s="" so the actions may be performed as follows:You need to restore the initial value of the string s using only the final value of t and find the order of removing letters from s.
1373	Simply Strange Sort You have a permutation: an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of distinct integers from 1 to n. The length of the permutation n is odd.Consider the following algorithm of sorting the permutation in increasing order.A helper procedure of the algorithm, f(i), takes a single argument i (1 \le i \le n-1) and does the following. If a_i > a_{i+1}, the values of a_i and a_{i+1} are exchanged. Otherwise, the permutation doesn't change.The algorithm consists of iterations, numbered with consecutive integers starting with 1. On the i-th iteration, the algorithm does the following: It can be proven that after a finite number of iterations the permutation will be sorted in increasing order.After how many iterations will this happen for the first time?
1374	Deep Down Below In a certain video game, the player controls a hero characterized by a single integer value: . The hero will have to beat monsters that are also characterized by a single integer value: .On the current level, the hero is facing n caves. To pass the level, the hero must enter all the caves in some order, each cave exactly once, and exit every cave safe and sound. When the hero enters cave i, he will have to fight k_i monsters in a row: first a monster with armor a_{i, 1}, then a monster with armor a_{i, 2} and so on, finally, a monster with armor a_{i, k_i}.The hero can beat a monster if and only if the hero's power is strictly greater than the monster's armor. If the hero can't beat the monster he's fighting, the game ends and the player loses. Note that once the hero enters a cave, he can't exit it before he fights all the monsters in it, strictly in the given order.Each time the hero beats a monster, the hero's power increases by 1.Find the smallest possible power the hero must start the level with to be able to enter all the caves in some order and beat all the monsters.
1375	The Miracle and the Sleeper You are given two integers l and r, l\le r. Find the largest possible value of a \bmod b over all pairs (a, b) of integers for which r\ge a \ge b \ge l.As a reminder, a \bmod b is a remainder we get when dividing a by b. For example, 26 \bmod 8 = 2.
1376	Scenes From a Memory During the hypnosis session, Nicholas suddenly remembered a positive integer n, which . Soon, when he returned home, he got curious: what is the maximum number of digits that can be removed from the number so that the number becomes , that is, either composite or equal to one?For some numbers doing so is impossible: for example, for number 53 it's impossible to delete some of its digits to obtain a not prime integer. However, .Note that you cannot remove all the digits from the number.A prime number is a number that has no divisors except one and itself. A composite is a number that has more than two divisors. 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number.
1377	Rings "How am I to tell which is the One?!" the mage howled."Throw them one by one into the Cracks of Doom and watch when Mordor falls!" Somewhere in a parallel Middle-earth, when Saruman caught Frodo, he only found n rings. And the i-th ring was either gold or silver. For convenience Saruman wrote down a binary string s of n characters, where the i-th character was  if the i-th ring was gold, and  if it was silver.Saruman has a magic function f, which takes a binary string and returns a number obtained by converting the string into a binary number and then converting the binary number into a decimal number. For example, f(001010) = 10, f(111) = 7, f(11011101) = 221.Saruman, however, thinks that the order of the rings plays some important role. He wants to find 2 pairs of integers (l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), such that:Here substring s[l:r] denotes s_ls_{l+1}\ldots s_{r-1}s_r, and \lfloor x \rfloor denotes rounding the number down to the nearest integer.Help Saruman solve this problem! It is guaranteed that under the constraints of the problem at least one solution exists.
1378	Rescue Niwen! Rise above the sands of time...After crossing the Windswept Wastes, Ori has finally reached the Windtorn Ruins to find the Heart of the Forest! However, the ancient repository containing this priceless Willow light did not want to open!Ori was taken aback, but the Voice of the Forest explained to him that the cunning Gorleks had decided to add protection to the repository.The Gorleks were very fond of the "string expansion" operation. They were also very fond of increasing subsequences.Suppose a string s_1s_2s_3 \ldots s_n is given. Then its "expansion" is defined as the sequence of strings s_1, s_1 s_2, ..., s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n, s_2, s_2 s_3, ..., s_2 s_3 \ldots s_n, s_3, s_3 s_4, ..., s_{n-1} s_n, s_n. For example, the "expansion" the string '' will be the following sequence of strings: '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''. To open the ancient repository, Ori must find the size of the largest increasing subsequence of the "expansion" of the string s. Here, strings are compared lexicographically.Help Ori with this task!A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:
1379	Tubular Bells Do you know what tubular bells are? They are a musical instrument made up of cylindrical metal tubes. In an orchestra, tubular bells are used to mimic the ringing of bells.Mike has tubular bells, too! They consist of n tubes, and each of the tubes has a length that can be expressed by a integer from l to r inclusive. It is clear that the lengths of all the tubes are different (it makes no sense to make the same tubes). It is also known that r-l+1 = n.Formally, we can say that Mike's tubular bells are described by a permutation a of length n that contains all numbers from l to r inclusive, with a_i denoting the length of the i-th tube.You are offered an interesting task: to guess what Mike's instrument looks like. Simply, you must guess the permutation.Mike won't tell you l or r. He will only tell you n, and will allow you to ask no more than n + 5000 queries.In each query, you name two positive integers x, y such that 1 \le x, y \le n, x \neq y. In response to this query, the program written by Mike will give you \mathrm{lcm}(a_x, a_y), where \mathrm{lcm}(c,d) denotes the least common multiple of c and d.Solve Mike's problem!
1380	Median Maximization You are given two positive integers n and s. Find the maximum possible median of an array of n  integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to s.A  of an array of integers of length m is the number standing on the \lceil {\frac{m}{2}} \rceil-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from 1. For example, a median of the array [20,40,20,50,50,30] is the \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil-th element of [20,20,30,40,50,50], so it is 30. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.
1381	MIN-MEX Cut A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1.Let \operatorname{MEX} of a binary string be the smallest digit among 0, 1, or 2 that does not occur in the string. For example, \operatorname{MEX} of 001011 is 2, because 0 and 1 occur in the string at least once, \operatorname{MEX} of 1111 is 0, because 0 and 2 do not occur in the string and 0 < 2.A binary string s is given. You should cut it into any number of substrings such that each character is in exactly one substring. It is possible to cut the string into a single substring — the whole string.A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.What is the  sum of \operatorname{MEX} of all substrings pieces can be?
1382	MAX-MEX Cut A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.Let \operatorname{MEX} of a bi-table be the smallest digit among 0, 1, or 2 that does not occur in the bi-table. For example, \operatorname{MEX} for \begin{bmatrix} 0011\\ 1010 \end{bmatrix} is 2, because 0 and 1 occur in the bi-table at least once. \operatorname{MEX} for \begin{bmatrix} 111\\ 111 \end{bmatrix} is 0, because 0 and 2 do not occur in the bi-table, and 0 < 2.You are given a bi-table with n columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table — the whole bi-table.What is the  sum of \operatorname{MEX} of all resulting bi-tables can be?
1383	Buds Re-hanging A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a vertex v (different from root) is the previous to v vertex on the shortest path from the root to the vertex v. Children of the vertex v are all vertices for which v is the parent.A vertex is a leaf if it has no children. We call a vertex a , if the following three conditions are satisfied: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. The vertex 1 is the root. In one operation you can choose any bud with all its children (they are leaves) and re-hang them to any other vertex of the tree. By doing that you delete the edge connecting the bud and its parent and add an edge between the bud and the chosen vertex of the tree. The chosen vertex cannot be the bud itself or any of its children. All children of the bud stay connected to the bud.What is the minimum number of leaves it is possible to get if you can make any number of the above-mentioned operations (possibly zero)?
1384	Points Movement There are n points and m segments on the coordinate line. The initial coordinate of the i-th point is a_i. The endpoints of the j-th segment are l_j and r_j — left and right endpoints, respectively.You can move the points. In one move you can move any point from its current coordinate x to the coordinate x - 1 or the coordinate x + 1. The cost of this move is 1.You should move the points in such a way that each segment is visited by at least one point. A point visits the segment [l, r] if there is a moment when its coordinate was on the segment [l, r] (including endpoints).You should find the minimal possible total cost of all moves such that all segments are visited.
1385	Domino Disaster Alice has a grid with 2 rows and n columns. She fully covers the grid using n dominoes of size 1 \times 2 — Alice may place them vertically or horizontally, and each cell should be covered by exactly one domino.Now, she decided to show one row of the grid to Bob. Help Bob and figure out what the other row of the grid looks like!
1386	MEXor Mixup Alice gave Bob two integers a and b (a > 0 and b \ge 0). Being a curious boy, Bob wrote down an array of  integers with \operatorname{MEX} value of all elements equal to a and \operatorname{XOR} value of all elements equal to b.What is the  possible length of the array Bob wrote?Recall that the \operatorname{MEX} () of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does  belong to the array and the \operatorname{XOR} of an array is the  of all the elements of the array.
1387	Carrying Conundrum Alice has just learned addition. However, she hasn't learned the concept of "carrying" fully — instead of carrying to the  column, she carries to the column .For example, the  way to evaluate the sum 2039 + 2976 would be as shown: However, Alice evaluates it as shown: In particular, this is what she does: Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to get a result of n. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way. Help Bob find the number of  such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of n. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a \ne b.
1388	Expression Evaluation Error On the board, Bob wrote n positive integers in  10 with sum s (i. e. in decimal numeral system). Alice sees the board, but accidentally interprets the numbers on the board as base-11 integers and adds them up (in base 11).What numbers should Bob write on the board, so Alice's sum is as large as possible?
1389	Non-Decreasing Dilemma Alice has recently received an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n for her birthday! She is very proud of her array, and when she showed her friend Bob the array, he was very happy with her present too!However, soon Bob became curious, and as any sane friend would do, asked Alice to perform q operations of two types on her array:Help Alice answer Bob's queries!
1390	One-Four Overload Alice has an empty grid with n rows and m columns. Some of the cells are marked, and . (Two squares are  if they share a side.) Alice wants to fill each cell with a number such that the following statements are true: 
1391	Balanced Substring You are given a string s, consisting of n letters, each letter is either '' or ''. The letters in the string are numbered from 1 to n.s[l; r] is a continuous substring of letters from index l to r of the string inclusive. A string is called balanced if the number of letters '' in it is equal to the number of letters ''. For example, strings "" and "" are balanced and strings "" and "" are not.Find any non-empty balanced substring s[l; r] of string s. Print its l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n). If there is no such substring, then print -1 -1.
1392	Chess Tournament A chess tournament will be held soon, where n chess players will take part. Every participant will play one game against every other participant. Each game ends in either a win for one player and a loss for another player, or a draw for both players.Each of the players has their own expectations about the tournament, they can be one of two types:You have to determine if there exists an outcome for all the matches such that all the players meet their expectations. If there are several possible outcomes, print any of them. If there are none, report that it's impossible.
1393	Jury Meeting n people gathered to hold a jury meeting of the upcoming competition, the i-th member of the jury came up with a_i tasks, which they want to share with each other.First, the jury decides on the order which they will follow while describing the tasks. Let that be a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n (an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once).Then the discussion goes as follows:A permutation p is nice if none of the jury members tell two or more of their own tasks in a row. Count the number of nice permutations. The answer may be really large, so print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1394	Inconvenient Pairs There is a city that can be represented as a square grid with corner points in (0, 0) and (10^6, 10^6).The city has n vertical and m horizontal streets that goes across the whole city, i. e. the i-th vertical streets goes from (x_i, 0) to (x_i, 10^6) and the j-th horizontal street goes from (0, y_j) to (10^6, y_j). All streets are bidirectional. Borders of the city are streets as well.There are k persons staying : the p-th person at point (x_p, y_p) (so either x_p equal to some x_i or y_p equal to some y_j, or both).Let's say that a pair of persons form an  if the shortest path from one person to another going only by streets is  than the Manhattan distance between them.Calculate the number of inconvenient pairs of persons (pairs (x, y) and (y, x) are the same pair).Let's recall that Manhattan distance between points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.
1395	Playoff Restoration 2^k teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of 2^k - 1 games. They are held as follows: first of all, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4 (exactly in this order), and so on (so, 2^{k-1} games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only 2^{k-1} teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, 2^{k-2} games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "1 vs 2" plays against the winner of the game "3 vs 4", then the winner of the game "5 vs 6" plays against the winner of the game "7 vs 8", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.After the tournament ends, the teams are assigned places according to the tournament phase when they were eliminated. In particular:For example, this picture describes one of the possible ways the tournament can go with k = 3, and the resulting places of the teams:After a tournament which was conducted by the aforementioned rules ended, its results were encoded in the following way. Let p_i be the place of the i-th team in the tournament. The hash value of the tournament h is calculated as h = (\sum \limits_{i=1}^{2^k} i \cdot A^{p_i}) \bmod 998244353, where A is some given integer.Unfortunately, due to a system crash, almost all tournament-related data was lost. The only pieces of data that remain are the values of k, A and h. You are asked to restore the resulting placing of the teams in the tournament, if it is possible at all.
1396	Palindromic Hamiltonian Path You are given a simple undirected graph with n vertices, n is even. You are going to write a letter on each vertex. Each letter should be one of the first k letters of the Latin alphabet.A path in the graph is called Hamiltonian if it visits each vertex exactly once. A string is called palindromic if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. A path in the graph is called palindromic if the letters on the vertices in it spell a palindromic string without changing the order.A string of length n is good if: Note that the path doesn't necesserily go through the vertices in order 1, 2, \dots, n.Count the number of good strings.
1397	Book You are given a book with n chapters.Each chapter has a specified list of other chapters that need to be understood in order to understand this chapter. To understand a chapter, you must read it after you understand every chapter on its required list.Currently you don't understand any of the chapters. You are going to read the book from the beginning till the end repeatedly until you understand the whole book. Note that if you read a chapter at a moment when you don't understand some of the required chapters, you don't understand this chapter.Determine how many times you will read the book to understand every chapter, or determine that you will never understand every chapter no matter how many times you read the book.
1398	Xor of 3 You are given a sequence a of length n consisting of 0s and 1s.You can perform the following operation on this sequence: We can prove that if there exists a sequence of operations of any length that changes all elements of a to 0s, then there is also such a sequence of length not greater than n.
1399	Paint You are given a 1 by n pixel image. The i-th pixel of the image has color a_i. For each color, the number of pixels of that color is  20.You can perform the following operation, which works like the bucket tool in paint programs, on this image: Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels in the image have the same color.
1400	Bridge Club There are currently n hot topics numbered from 0 to n-1 at your local bridge club and 2^n players numbered from 0 to 2^n-1. Each player holds a different set of views on those n topics, more specifically, the i-th player holds a positive view on the j-th topic if i\ \&\ 2^j > 0, and a negative view otherwise. Here \& denotes the .You are going to organize a bridge tournament capable of accommodating at most k pairs of players (bridge is played in teams of two people). You can select teams arbitrarily while each player is in at most one team, but there is one catch: two players cannot be in the same pair if they disagree on 2 or more of those n topics, as they would argue too much during the play.You know that the i-th player will pay you a_i dollars if they play in this tournament. Compute the maximum amount of money that you can earn if you pair the players in your club optimally.
1401	Polygon You are given a strictly convex polygon with n vertices.You will make k cuts that meet the following conditions: Your task is to maximize the area of the smallest region that will be formed by the polygon and those k cuts.
1402	Stations There are n cities in a row numbered from 1 to n.The cities will be building broadcasting stations. The station in the i-th city has height h_i and range w_i. It can broadcast information to city j if the following constraints are met: At the beginning, for every city i, h_i = 0 and w_i = i.Then q events will take place. During i-th event one of the following will happen: Your task is to react to all events and print answers to all queries.
1403	Countdown You are given a digital clock with n digits. Each digit shows an integer from 0 to 9, so the whole clock shows an integer from 0 to 10^n-1. The clock will show leading zeroes if the number is smaller than 10^{n-1}.You want the clock to show 0 with as few operations as possible. In an operation, you can do one of the following: Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the clock show 0.
1404	Swaps You are given two arrays a and b of length n. Array a contains each  integer from 1 to 2n in an arbitrary order, and array b contains each  integer from 1 to 2n in an arbitrary order.You can perform the following operation on those arrays: For two different arrays x and y of the same length n, we say that x is lexicographically smaller than y if in the first position where x and y differ, the array x has a smaller element than the corresponding element in y.
1405	Regular Bracket Sequences A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "" and "". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "" and "" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "" and "" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "" and ""), and "", "" and "" are not.You are given an integer n. Your goal is to construct and print  different regular bracket sequences of length 2n.
1406	Combinatorics Homework You are given four integer values a, b, c and m.Check if there exists a string that contains: 
1407	Slay the Dragon Recently, Petya learned about a new game "Slay the Dragon". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of n heroes, the strength of the i-th hero is equal to a_i.According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to x, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least x to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is y, then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least y.The player can increase the strength of any hero by 1 for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.There are m dragons in the game, the i-th of them has defense equal to x_i and attack power equal to y_i. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the i-th dragon.Note that the task is solved  (improvements are not saved).
1408	The Strongest Build Ivan is playing yet another roguelike computer game. He controls a single hero in the game. The hero has n equipment slots. There is a list of c_i items for the i-th slot, the j-th of them increases the hero strength by a_{i,j}. The items for each slot are pairwise distinct and are listed in the increasing order of their strength increase. So, a_{i,1} < a_{i,2} < \dots < a_{i,c_i}.For each slot Ivan chooses exactly one item. Let the chosen item for the i-th slot be the b_i-th item in the corresponding list. The sequence of choices [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n] is called .The strength of a build is the sum of the strength increases of the items in it. Some builds are banned from the game. There is a list of m pairwise distinct banned builds. It's guaranteed that there's at least one build that's not banned.What is the build with the maximum strength that is not banned from the game? If there are multiple builds with maximum strength, print any of them.
1409	Coloring A matrix of size n \times m, such that each cell of it contains either 0 or 1, is considered  if the sum in every contiguous submatrix of size 2 \times 2 is exactly 2, i. e. every "square" of size 2 \times 2 contains exactly two 1's and exactly two 0's.You are given a matrix of size n \times m. Initially each cell of this matrix is empty. Let's denote the cell on the intersection of the x-th row and the y-th column as (x, y). You have to process the queries of three types:After each query, print the number of ways to fill the empty cells of the matrix so that the resulting matrix is . Since the answers can be large, print them modulo 998244353.
1410	Occurrences A subarray of array a from index l to the index r is the array [a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{r}]. The number of occurrences of the array b in the array a is the number of subarrays of a such that they are equal to b.You are given n arrays A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n; the elements of these arrays are integers from 1 to k. You have to build an array a consisting of m integers from 1 to k in such a way that, for  given subarray A_i, the number of occurrences of A_i in the array a is  than the number of occurrences of each non-empty subarray of A_i in a. Note that if A_i doesn't occur in a, and no subarray of A_i occurs in a, this condition is still met for A_i.Your task is to calculate the number of different arrays a you can build, and print it modulo 998244353.
1411	Another Sorting Problem Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it , where , and .A string a occurs before a string b in  order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:
1412	Building an Amusement Park Mr. Chanek lives in a city represented as a plane. He wants to build an amusement park in the shape of a circle of radius r. The circle must  the origin (point (0, 0)).There are n bird habitats that can be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The i-th bird habitat is at point p_i = (x_i, y_i). Find the minimum radius r of a park with  k bird habitats inside. A point is considered to be inside the park if and only if the distance between p_i and the center of the park is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and the radius of the park do not need to be integers..
1413	Cyclic Sum Denote a cyclic sequence of size n as an array s such that s_n is adjacent to s_1. The segment s[r, l] where l < r is the concatenation of s[r, n] and s[1, l].You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Define b as the cyclic sequence obtained from concatenating m copies of a. Note that b has size n \cdot m.You are given an integer k where k = 1 or k is a prime number. Find the number of different segments in b where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by k.. For example, when n = 3 and m = 2, the set of indices for segment s[2, 5] is \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, and for segment s[5, 2] is \{5, 6, 1, 2\}. In particular, the segments s[1, 6], s[2,1], \ldots, s[6, 5] are considered as the same segment.Output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
1414	Divisible by Twenty-Five Mr. Chanek has an integer represented by a string s. Zero or more digits have been erased and are denoted by the character . There are also zero or more digits marked by the character , meaning they're the same digit.Mr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer s, where s is divisible by 25. Of course, s must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character  with any digit. He can also replace the character  with any digit, but it must be the same for every character .As a note, a leading zero is any  digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example,  has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, ( has no leading zero, but  has three leading zeroes).
1415	Eye-Pleasing City Park Tour There is a city park represented as a tree with n attractions as its vertices and n - 1 rails as its edges. The i-th attraction has happiness value a_i.Each rail has a color. It is either black if t_i = 0, or white if t_i = 1. Black trains only operate on a black rail track, and white trains only operate on a white rail track. If you are previously on a black train and want to ride a white train, or you are previously on a white train and want to ride a black train, you need to use 1 ticket.The path of a tour must be a simple path — it must not visit an attraction more than once. You do not need a ticket the first time you board a train. You only have k tickets, meaning . In particular, you do not need a ticket to go through a path consisting of one rail color.Define f(u, v) as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour (u, v), which is a simple path that starts at the u-th attraction and ends at the v-th attraction. Find the sum of f(u,v) for all valid tours (u, v) (1 \leq u \leq v \leq n) that does not need more than k tickets, modulo 10^9 + 7.
1416	Finding Expected Value Mr. Chanek opened a letter from his fellow, who is currently studying at Singanesia. Here is what it says.Define an array b (0 \leq b_i < k) with n integers. While there exists a pair (i, j) such that b_i \ne b_j, do the following operation:Denote f(b) as the expected number of operations done to b until all elements of b are equal. You are given two integers n and k, and an array a (-1 \leq a_i < k) of n integers. For every index i with a_i = -1, replace a_i with a random number j satisfying 0 \leq j < k. Let c be the number of occurrences of -1 in a. There are k^c possibilites of a after the replacement, each with equal probability of being the final array.Find the expected value of f(a) modulo 10^9 + 7. Formally, let M = 10^9 + 7. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \frac{p}{q}, where p and q are integers and q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}. Output the integer equal to p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M. In other words, output such an integer x that 0 \le x < M and x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}.After reading the letter, Mr. Chanek gave the task to you. Solve it for the sake of their friendship!
1417	Anti-Tetris Let us consider the game "Sticky Tetris". In this game, there is a field of n \times m squares. Tiles appear on the field and the player can move the tiles. Each tile is a 4-connected set of at most 7 squares.Each new tile appears in any position that fits inside the field, does not intersect any other tile, and the top cell of the tile is at the top row of the field. The player can move the tile left, right, and down, and at any moment the tile must still entirely fit inside the field and must not intersect other tiles. The player can stop the tile at any position at any time. After that, it cannot be moved. Since this is "Sticky Tetris," the tile will not fall once stopped.You are given a final configuration of a "Sticky Tetris" game. You need to restore a sequence of steps that leads to that configuration if it exists.
1418	Building Forest Trails There are n villages lying equidistant on a circle in the middle of a thick, impassable forest. From ancient times, it was impossible to move from one village to another, but technical progress has changed a lot. Now, there is a technology to build passable trails in the forest. The building process consists of m events. Each event is either building a trail or querying if two villages are connected. Trails are built as straight lines connecting two villages. After a trail is built, anybody can walk along the trail from one village to another. Moreover, if two trails cross, anybody can turn at the intersection, and if other trails leave a village you have just reached, they can also be used to walk along. So, for example, if villages are numbered 1 to 6 in the order around the circle, and there are trails 1 to 3, 2 to 4, and 4 to 6, then all villages, except the 5-th, are reachable from the 1-st village.Given a list of m events, for each query, find if two given villages are reachable from each other at that moment.
1419	Easy Scheduling Eonathan Eostar decided to learn the magic of multiprocessor systems. He has a full binary tree of tasks with height h. In the beginning, there is only one  task in the tree — the task in the root. At each moment of time, p processes choose at most p  tasks and perform them. After that, tasks whose parents were performed become  for the next moment of time. Once the task becomes , it stays  until it is performed. You shall calculate the smallest number of time moments the system needs to perform all the tasks.
1420	Framing Pictures Life has been discovered on Venus! What is more, the life forms appear to be convex polygons. An international consortium is designing a probe to send to Venus to take pictures, but they need to estimate the bandwidth needed to send back pictures.When the probe takes a picture of a life form and wishes to send it back to Earth, the bandwidth required is proportional to the area of the bounding box (in other words, the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains the life-form). The shape and size of the life forms are known, but the orientation relative to the camera is random. You must thus determine the  (average) area of the bounding box across all orientations.
1421	Casimir's String Solitaire Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters '', '', and '' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.For example, with s = "" he can obtain a string s = "" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of '' and the second occurrence of ''). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.For a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?
1422	Shifting Sort The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \ldots n] = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n].This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array,  (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: For example, if a = [1, \color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \ldots 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the , and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.
1423	Ticks Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n \times m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).Casimir draws  of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 \times 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.You are given a description of a checkered field of size n \times m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d \ge k for all the ticks).Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d \ge k or not.
1424	Productive Meeting An important meeting is to be held and there are exactly n people invited. At any moment, any two people can step back and talk in private. The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.Each person has limited . The sociability of the i-th person is a non-negative integer a_i. This means that after exactly a_i talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If a_i = 0, the i-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.A meeting is considered most  if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.You are given an array of sociability a, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.
1425	Array Stabilization (AND version) You are given an array a[0 \ldots n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.In one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules:  It means that the whole array a^{\rightarrow d} can be represented as a sequence a^{\rightarrow d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, \ldots, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n - d - 1}] For example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{\rightarrow d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0 \,\&\, 1, 0 \,\&\, 0, 1 \,\&\, 0, 1 \,\&\, 1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].The process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.
1426	Portal CQXYM found a rectangle A of size n \times m. There are n rows and m columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.A rectangle M size of a \times b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:CQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.
1427	Mathematics Curriculum Let c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n be a permutation of integers 1, 2, \ldots, n. Consider all subsegments of this permutation containing an integer x. Given an integer m, we call the integer x  if there are exactly m different values of maximum on these subsegments.Cirno is studying mathematics, and the teacher asks her to count the number of permutations of length n with exactly k  numbers.Unfortunately, Cirno isn't good at mathematics, and she can't answer this question. Therefore, she asks you for help.Since the answer may be very big, you only need to tell her the number of permutations modulo p.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
1428	Train Maintenance Kawasiro Nitori is excellent in engineering. Thus she has been appointed to help maintain trains.There are n models of trains, and Nitori's department will only have at most one train of each model at any moment. In the beginning, there are no trains, at each of the following m days, one train will be added, or one train will be removed. When a train of model i is added at day t, it works for x_i days (day t inclusive), then it is in maintenance for y_i days, then in work for x_i days again, and so on until it is removed.In order to make management easier, Nitori wants you to help her calculate how many trains are in maintenance in each day.
1429	Subsequence Alice has an integer sequence a of length n and . She will choose a subsequence of a of length m, and defines the value of a subsequence a_{b_1},a_{b_2},\ldots,a_{b_m} as \sum_{i = 1}^m (m \cdot a_{b_i}) - \sum_{i = 1}^m \sum_{j = 1}^m f(\min(b_i, b_j), \max(b_i, b_j)), where f(i, j) denotes \min(a_i, a_{i + 1}, \ldots, a_j).Alice wants you to help her to maximize the value of the subsequence she choose.A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence t if s can be obtained from t by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
1430	Railway Construction Because the railway system in Gensokyo is often congested, as an enthusiastic engineer, Kawasiro Nitori plans to construct more railway to ease the congestion.There are n stations numbered from 1 to n and m two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.Because of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.Due to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.To save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.
1431	Problems for Codeforces XYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare n problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem i will be an integer a_i, where a_i \geq 0. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy a_i+a_{i+1}<m (1 \leq i < n), and a_1+a_n<m, where m is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo 998\,244\,353.Two plans of difficulty a and b are different only if there is an integer i (1 \leq i \leq n) satisfying a_i \neq b_i.
1432	CQXYM Count Permutations CQXYM is counting permutations length of 2n.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).A permutation p(length of 2n) will be counted only if the number of i satisfying p_i<p_{i+1} is no less than n. For example:CQXYM wants you to help him to count the number of such permutations modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).In addition,  is to get the remainder. For example:
1433	Diameter of Graph CQXYM wants to create a connected undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, and the diameter of the graph must be strictly less than k-1. Also, CQXYM doesn't want a graph that contains self-loops or multiple edges (i.e. each edge connects two different vertices and between each pair of vertices there is at most one edge).The diameter of a graph is the maximum distance between any two nodes.The distance between two nodes is the minimum number of the edges on the path which endpoints are the two nodes.CQXYM wonders whether it is possible to create such a graph.
1434	Luntik and Concerts Luntik has decided to try singing. He has a one-minute songs, b two-minute songs and c three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all songs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one concert.He wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts as small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of all songs in that concert.Please help Luntik and find the minimal possible difference in minutes between the concerts durations.
1435	Luntik and Subsequences Luntik came out for a morning stroll and found an array a of length n. He calculated the sum s of the elements of the array (s= \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i). Luntik calls a subsequence of the array a  if the sum of the numbers in that subsequence is equal to s-1.Luntik really wants to know the number of  subsequences of the array a. But he needs to come home so he asks you to solve that problem!A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained from y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
1436	Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a pattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Grandpa Sher wrote a string s of length n.Grandma Capa wants to knit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit from a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.She also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the  letter she chose.A string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings , ,  and  are palindromes, while the strings  and  are not.
1437	Vupsen, Pupsen and 0 Vupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the number 0, he threw away all numbers equal to 0 from the array. As a result, he got an array a of length n.Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number 0 and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array b of length n such that \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \cdot b_i=0. Since Vupsen doesn't like number 0, . Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so . Please help Vupsen to find any such array b!
1438	Pchelyonok and Segments Pchelyonok decided to give Mila a gift. Pchelenok has already bought an array a of length n, but gifting an array is too common. Instead of that, he decided to gift Mila the segments of that array!Pchelyonok wants his gift to be beautiful, so he decided to choose k non-overlapping segments of the array [l_1,r_1], [l_2,r_2], \ldots [l_k,r_k] such that:Pchelenok also wants his gift to be as beautiful as possible, so he asks you to find the maximal value of k such that he can give Mila a gift!
1439	Windblume Ode You have obtained the elegant bow known as the Windblume Ode. Inscribed in the weapon is an array of n (n \ge 3) positive  integers (i.e. different, no duplicates are allowed).Find the largest subset (i.e. having the maximum number of elements) of this array such that its sum is a composite number. A positive integer x is called composite if there exists a positive integer y such that 1 < y < x and x is divisible by y.If there are multiple subsets with this largest size with the composite sum, you can output any of them. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem such a non-empty subset always exists.
1440	Omkar and Heavenly Tree Lord Omkar would like to have a tree with n nodes (3 \le n \le 10^5) and has asked his disciples to construct the tree. However, Lord Omkar has created m (\mathbf{1 \le m < n}) restrictions to ensure that the tree will be as heavenly as possible. A tree with n nodes is an connected undirected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges. Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.Here is an example of a tree: A restriction consists of 3 pairwise distinct integers, a, b, and c (1 \le a,b,c \le n). It signifies that node b cannot lie on the simple path between node a and node c. Can you help Lord Omkar and become his most trusted disciple? You will need to find heavenly trees for multiple sets of restrictions. It can be shown that a heavenly tree will always exist for any set of restrictions under the given constraints.
1441	Omkar and Determination Consider a grid in which some cells are empty and some cells are filled. Call a cell in this grid  if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself, so all filled in cells are not exitable. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.Let's call a grid  if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.You are given a grid a of dimensions n \times m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \ldots, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.
1442	Omkar and the Meaning of Life It turns out that the meaning of life is a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of the integers 1, 2, \ldots, n (2 \leq n \leq 100). Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.A query consists of an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is  required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, \ldots, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.You can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.
1443	Moment of Bloom Hu Tao, being the little prankster she is, has tried to scare you with this graph problem! You are given a connected undirected graph of n nodes with m edges. You also have q queries. Each query consists of two nodes a and b.Initially, all edges in the graph have a weight of 0. For each query, you must choose a simple path starting from a and ending at b. Then you add 1 to every edge along this path. Determine if it's possible, after processing all q queries, for all edges in this graph to have an even weight. If so, output the choice of paths for each query. If it is not possible, determine the smallest number of extra queries you could add to make it possible. It can be shown that this number will not exceed 10^{18} under the given constraints.A simple path is defined as any path that does not visit a node more than once.An edge is said to have an even weight if its value is divisible by 2.
1444	Defender of Childhood Dreams You find yourself playing with Teucer again in the city of Liyue. As you take the eccentric little kid around, you notice something interesting about the structure of the city.Liyue can be represented as a directed graph containing n nodes. Nodes are labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and only if a < b.A path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges.Teucer's favorite number is k. You are curious about the following scenario: If you were to label each edge with a color, what is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths?Teucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task!
1445	Mathematical Addition Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form:Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.
1446	Coloring Rectangles David was given a  checkered rectangle of size n \times m. But he doesn't like it. So David cuts the original or any other rectangle piece obtained during the cutting into two new pieces along the grid lines. He can do this operation as many times as he wants.As a result, he will get a set of rectangles. Rectangles 1 \times 1 are .David also knows how to paint the cells . He wants each rectangle from the resulting set of pieces to be colored such that any pair of adjacent cells by side (from the same piece) have different colors.What is the minimum number of cells David will have to paint?
1447	Two Arrays You are given two arrays of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n.Let's define a transformation of the array a:Is it possible to perform some transformation of the array a , so that the resulting array is equal to b?
1448	Guess the Permutation Jury initially had a sequence a of length n, such that a_i = i.The jury chose three integers i, j, k, such that 1 \leq i < j < k \leq n, j - i > 1. After that, Jury reversed subsegments [i, j - 1] and [j, k] of the sequence a.Reversing a subsegment [l, r] of the sequence a means reversing the order of elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r in the sequence, i. e. a_l is swapped with a_r, a_{l+1} is swapped with a_{r-1}, etc.You are given the number n and you should find i, j, k after asking some questions.In one question you can choose two integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n) and ask the number of inversions on the subsegment [l, r] of the sequence a. You will be given the number of pairs (i, j) such that l \leq i < j \leq r, and a_i > a_j.Find the chosen numbers i, j, k after at most 40 questions.The numbers i, j, and k are fixed before the start of your program and do not depend on your queries.
1449	Game with Stones Bob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for himself. The game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be described with a sequence of integers s_1, \ldots, s_k, where s_i is the number of stones in the i-th pile. On each turn, Bob picks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles i and i+1 and takes one stone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles . The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers himself a winner if at the end all piles are empty.We consider a sequence of piles  if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.You are given a sequence a_1, \ldots, a_n, count the number of subsegments of a that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other words find the number of segments [l, r] (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n), such that the sequence a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r is winning.
1450	Strange LCS You are given n strings s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, each consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters. In addition, it's guaranteed that each character occurs in each string . Find the longest common subsequence of these strings.A string t is a subsequence of a string s if t can be obtained from s by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) symbols.
1451	Life of a Flower Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.The flower grows as follows: At the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?
1452	Array Eversion You are given an array a of length n.Let's define the  operation. Let x = a_n. Then array a is partitioned into two parts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of a that are not greater than x (\le x). The right part contains the elements of a that are strictly greater than x (> x). The order of elements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the partition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the left and the right parts.For example, if the array a is [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], the eversion goes like this: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \to [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \to [2, 1, 3, 4, 5].We start with the array a and perform eversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array a stops changing. Output the minimum number k such that the array stops changing after k eversions.
1453	Minimize Distance A total of n depots are located on a number line. Depot i lies at the point x_i for 1 \le i \le n.You are a salesman with n bags of goods, attempting to deliver one bag to each of the n depots. You and the n bags are initially at the origin 0. You can carry up to k bags at a time. You must collect the required number of goods from the origin, deliver them to the respective depots, and then return to the origin to collect your next batch of goods.Calculate the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots. You do  have to return to the origin after you have delivered all the bags.
1454	Yet Another Sorting Problem Petya has an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. He only likes sorted arrays. Unfortunately, the given array could be arbitrary, so Petya wants to sort it.Petya likes to challenge himself, so he wants to sort array using only 3-cycles. More formally, in one operation he can pick 3  indices i, j, and k (1 \leq i, j, k \leq n) and apply i \to j \to k \to i cycle to the array a. It simultaneously places a_i on position j, a_j on position k, and a_k on position i, without changing any other element.For example, if a is [10, 50, 20, 30, 40, 60] and he chooses i = 2, j = 1, k = 5, then the array becomes [\underline{50}, \underline{40}, 20, 30, \underline{10}, 60].Petya can apply arbitrary number of 3-cycles (possibly, zero). You are to determine if Petya can sort his array a, i. e. make it non-decreasing.
1455	Frequency Queries Petya has a rooted tree with an integer written on each vertex. The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree.A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root.Each question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: For example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1.Please answer all questions about the tree.
1456	Non-equal Neighbours You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n such that: The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
1457	Eligible Segments You are given n  points p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n on the plane and a positive integer R. Find the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that 1 \le i < j \le n, and for every possible k (1 \le k \le n) the distance from the point p_k to the  between points p_i and p_j is at most R.
1458	Jumping Through the Array You are given an array of integers a of size n and a permutation p of size n. There are q queries of three types coming to you:Please, process all queries and print answers to queries of type 1.
1459	Gamer Hemose There is an Agent in Valorant, and he has n weapons. The i-th weapon has a damage value a_i, and the Agent will face an enemy whose health value is H.The Agent will perform one or more moves until the enemy dies.In one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the enemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will become less than or equal to 0. However, not everything is so easy: .What is the minimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy?
1460	Hemose Shopping Hemose has an array of n integers. He wants Samez to sort the array in the non-decreasing order. Since it would be a too easy problem for Samez, Hemose allows Samez to use only the following operation:Choose indices i and j such that 1 \le i, j \le n, and \lvert i - j \rvert \geq x. Then, swap elements a_i and a_j.Can you tell Samez if there's a way to sort the array in the non-decreasing order by using the operation written above some finite number of times (possibly 0)?
1461	Bakry and Partitioning Bakry faced a problem, but since he's lazy to solve it, he asks for your help.You are given a tree of n nodes, the i-th node has value a_i assigned to it for each i from 1 to n. As a reminder, a tree on n nodes is a connected graph with n-1 edges.You want to delete  from the tree, so that the following condition would hold:For every connected component calculate the  of the values of the nodes in it. Then, these values have to be the same for all connected components.Is it possible to achieve this condition?
1462	Hemose in ICPC ? Zeyad knows that Hemose loves tree problems, so he gave him a tree problem with a very special device.Hemose has a weighted tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. Unfortunately, Hemose doesn't remember the weights of edges.Let's define Dist(u, v) for u\neq v as the greatest common divisor of the weights of all edges on the path from node u to node v.Hemose has a special device. Hemose can give the device a set of nodes, and the device will return the largest Dist between any two nodes from the set. More formally, if Hemose gives the device a set S of nodes, the device will return the largest value of Dist(u, v) over all pairs (u, v) with u, v \in S and u \neq v.Hemose can use this Device , and wants to find any two distinct nodes a, b, such that Dist(a, b) is maximum possible. Can you help him?
1463	Bored Bakry Bakry got bored of solving problems related to xor, so he asked you to solve this problem for him.You are given an array a of n integers [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n].Let's call a subarray a_{l}, a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \ldots, a_r  if a_l \, \& \, a_{l+1} \, \& \, a_{l+2} \, \ldots \, \& \, a_r > a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus a_{l+2} \ldots \oplus a_r, where \oplus denotes the  and \& denotes the .Find the length of the longest good subarray of a, or determine that no such subarray exists.
1464	Elections The elections in which three candidates participated have recently ended. The first candidate received a votes, the second one received b votes, the third one received c votes. For each candidate, solve the following problem: how many votes should be added to this candidate so that he wins the election (i.e. the number of votes for this candidate was strictly greater than the number of votes for any other candidate)?Please note that for each candidate it is necessary to solve this problem , i.e. the added votes for any candidate  affect the calculations when getting the answer for the other two candidates.
1465	Make it Divisible by 25 It is given a positive integer n. In 1 move, one can select any single digit and remove it (i.e. one selects some position in the number and removes the digit located at this position). The operation cannot be performed if only one digit remains. If the resulting number contains leading zeroes, they are automatically removed.E.g. if one removes from the number 32925 the 3-rd digit, the resulting number will be 3225. If one removes from the number 20099050 the first digit, the resulting number will be 99050 (the 2 zeroes going next to the first digit are automatically removed).What is the minimum number of steps to get a number such that it is divisible by 25 and ? It is guaranteed that, for each n occurring in the input, the answer exists. It is guaranteed that the number n has no leading zeros.
1466	Save More Mice There are one cat, k mice, and one hole on a coordinate line. The cat is located at the point 0, the hole is located at the point n. All mice are located between the cat and the hole: the i-th mouse is located at the point x_i (0 < x_i < n). At each point, many mice can be located.In one second, the following happens. First,  mouse moves to the right by 1. If the mouse reaches the hole, it hides (i.e. the mouse will not any more move to any point and will not be eaten by the cat). Then ( the mouse has finished its move) the cat moves to the right by 1. If at the new cat's position, some mice are located, the cat eats them (they will not be able to move after that). The actions are performed until any mouse hasn't been hidden or isn't eaten.In other words, the first move is made by a mouse. If the mouse has reached the hole, it's saved. Then the cat makes a move. The cat eats the mice located at the pointed the cat has reached (if the cat has reached the hole, it eats nobody).Each second, you can select a mouse that will make a move. What is the maximum number of mice that can reach the hole without being eaten?
1467	Gardener and Tree A tree is an undirected connected graph in which there are no cycles. This problem is about non-rooted trees. A leaf of a tree is a vertex that is connected to  vertex.The gardener Vitaly grew a tree from n vertices. He decided to trim the tree. To do this, he performs a number of operations. In one operation, he removes  leaves of the tree.For example, consider the tree shown in the figure above. The figure below shows the result of applying exactly one operation to the tree.Note the special cases of the operation:Vitaly applied k operations sequentially to the tree. How many vertices remain?
1468	Red-Black Number It is given a non-negative integer x, the decimal representation of which contains n digits. You need to color  its digit in red or black, so that the number formed by the red digits is divisible by A, and the number formed by the black digits is divisible by B. digit must be colored in each of two colors. Consider, the count of digits colored in red is r and the count of digits colored in black is b. Among all possible colorings of the given number x, you need to output any such that the value of |r - b| is .Note that the number x and the numbers formed by digits of each color, .The figure above shows an example of painting the number x = 02165 of n = 5 digits for A = 3 and B = 13. The red digits form the number 015, which is divisible by 3, and the black ones — 26, which is divisible by 13. Note that the absolute value of the difference between the counts of red and black digits is 1, it is impossible to achieve a smaller value.
1469	Consecutive Sum Riddle Theofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese).You are given an integer n. You need to find two integers l and r such that -10^{18} \le l < r \le 10^{18} and l + (l + 1) + \ldots + (r - 1) + r = n.
1470	Special Numbers Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.Let's call a positive number  if it can be written as a sum of  non-negative powers of n. For example, for n = 4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17, but 9 is not.Theofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 10^9+7.
1471	Make Them Equal Theofanis has a string s_1 s_2 \dots s_n and a character c. He wants to make all characters of the string equal to c using the minimum number of operations.In one operation he can choose a number x (1 \le x \le n) and , where i is  divisible by x, replace s_i with c. Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to c and the x-s that he should use in his operations.
1472	The Number of Imposters Theofanis started playing the new online game called "Among them". However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: "Andreas" (the most common name in Cyprus).In each game, Theofanis plays with n other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from 1 to n.The players write m comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of "i j c" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 \le i, j \le n; i \neq j; c is either  or ). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c.An imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. Help Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).Note that each player has exactly  role: either  or .
1473	Ideal Farm Theofanis decided to visit his uncle's farm. There are s animals and n animal pens on the farm. For utility purpose, animal pens are constructed in one row.Uncle told Theofanis that a farm is  if you can distribute all animals in all pens in such a way that there are no empty pens and there is at least one continuous segment of pens that has exactly k animals in total.Moreover, a farm is  if it's lucky for any distribution without empty pens.Neither Theofanis nor his uncle knows if their farm is ideal or not. Can you help them to figure it out?
1474	Computer Game Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1, 1) — at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column.Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x_1, y_1) to cell (x_2, y_2) in one step if |x_1 - x_2| \le 1 and |y_1 - y_2| \le 1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2, n) — at the intersection of row 2 and column n.Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.
1475	Groups n students attended the first meeting of the Berland SU programming course (n is even). All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.Each student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not. Your task is to determine if it is possible to choose two different week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.
1476	Delete Two Elements Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer). The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e. sum divided by n).Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n - 2) elements is still equal to k.Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i, j] (i < j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n - 2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).
1477	Training Session Monocarp is the coach of the Berland State University programming teams. He decided to compose a problemset for a training session for his teams.Monocarp has n problems that none of his students have seen yet. The i-th problem has a topic a_i (an integer from 1 to n) and a difficulty b_i (an integer from 1 to n). All problems are different, that is, there are no two tasks that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.Monocarp decided to select exactly 3 problems from n problems for the problemset. The problems should satisfy  of two conditions (possibly, both):Your task is to determine the number of ways to select three problems for the problemset.
1478	Staircases You are given a matrix, consisting of n rows and m columns. The rows are numbered top to bottom, the columns are numbered left to right.Each cell of the matrix can be either free or locked.Let's call a path in the matrix  if it: In particular, a path, consisting of a single cell, is considered to be a staircase.Here are some examples of staircases:Initially all the cells of the matrix are .You have to process q queries, each of them flips the state of a single cell. So, if a cell is currently free, it makes it locked, and if a cell is currently locked, it makes it free.Print the number of different staircases after each query. Two staircases are considered different if there exists such a cell that appears in one path and doesn't appear in the other path.
1479	RBS A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "" and "". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "" and "" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:Let's denote the concatenation of two strings x and y as x+y. For example, "" + "" = "".You are given n bracket sequences s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n. You can rearrange them in any order (you can rearrange only the strings themselves, but not the characters in them).Your task is to rearrange the strings in such a way that the string s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_n has as many non-empty prefixes that are RBS as possible.
1480	Weights You are given an array A of length N weights of masses A_1, A_2...A_N. No two weights have the same mass. You can put every weight on one side of the balance (left or right). You don't have to put weights in order A_1,...,A_N. There is also a string S consisting of characters "L" and "R", meaning that after putting the i-th weight (not A_i, but i-th weight of your choice) left or right side of the balance should be heavier. Find the order of putting the weights on the balance such that rules of string S are satisfied. 
1481	Bubble Strike Little Johnny Bubbles enjoys spending hours in front of his computer playing video games. His favorite game is Bubble Strike, fast-paced bubble shooting online game for two players.Each game is set in one of the N maps, each having different terrain configuration. First phase of each game decides on which map the game will be played. The game system randomly selects three maps and shows them to the players. Each player must pick one of those three maps to be discarded. The game system then randomly selects one of the maps that were not picked by any of the players and starts the game.Johnny is deeply enthusiastic about the game and wants to spend some time studying maps, thus increasing chances to win games played on those maps. However, he also needs to do his homework, so he does not have time to study all the maps. That is why he asked himself the following question: "What is the minimum number of maps I have to study, so that the probability to play one of those maps is at least P"?Can you help Johnny find the answer for this question? You can assume Johnny's opponents do not know him, and they will randomly pick maps.
1482	Two Arrays You are given two integer arrays of length N, A1 and A2. You are also given Q queries of 4 types: 1 k l r x: set Ak_i:=min(Ak_i, x) for each l \leq i \leq r.2 k l r x: set Ak_i:=max(Ak_i, x) for each l \leq i \leq r.3 k l r x: set Ak_i:=Ak_i+x for each l \leq i \leq r.4 l r: find the (\sum_{i=l}^r F(A1_i+A2_i)) \% (10^9+7) where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number (F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(k)=F(k-1)+F(k-2)), and x \% y denotes the remainder of the division of x by y.You should process these queries and answer each query of the fourth type.
1483	Mars In the year 2420 humans have finally built a colony on Mars thanks to the work of Elon Tusk. There are 10^9+7 cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once and Q queries that you need to answer. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from L_{i} to R_{i} on that list using only roads of length D_{i}.
